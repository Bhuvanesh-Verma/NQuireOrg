Create standards, policies, tools, and programs for businesses that prioritize positive social and environmental impact. By doing so, these collaborative efforts help drive responsible business practices and encourage companies to become B Corps.\n3.

This process helps identify and recognize businesses that are actively working towards creating a better world.\n4. Encourage and empower businesses to manage their impact effectively using tools such as the B Impact Assessment and the SDG Action Manager. These resources assist companies in measuring and improving their social and environmental performance.\n5. Advocate for and influence the adoption of stakeholder governance models and beneficial legal frameworks that enable companies to prioritize social and environmental concerns alongside financial ones.\n6. Build a global network of individuals and organizations dedicated to creating a more sustainable, equitable, and socially responsible economy. This network fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and collective action towards achieving common goals.\n7. Continuously innovate and evolve the B Corp certification and broader movement to stay ahead of emerging trends and challenges in the field of social and environmental entrepreneurship.\n\nBy pursuing these shared objectives, the collaborations between B Lab, B Corps, and others can expect numerous positive outcomes, including increased awareness and adoption of socially and environmentally responsible business practices, improved overall social and environmental performance within industries, and a growing global community dedicated to driving meaningful change.",
