            "result": " Based on the provided text, it seems that there are several sustainable or environmental practices being mentioned. These include:\n\n1. Rehabilitation of degraded land: The text mentions \"degraded land\" which suggests that efforts are being made to restore and revitalize lands that have been damaged or destroyed due to various reasons such as deforestation, overgrazing, or poor agricultural practices. This process not only helps to regenerate ecosystems but also contributes to carbon sequestration by increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil.\n2. Carbon sequestration: Another important aspect mentioned in the text is the ability of the mentioned initiatives to \"sequester even more carbon.\" This implies that these projects are actively involved in capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, helping to mitigate climate change. It can be assumed that this is achieved through various means such as afforestation, agroforestry, or improved soil management practices.",
