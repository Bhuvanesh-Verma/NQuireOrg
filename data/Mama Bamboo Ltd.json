Planting bamboo in a previously deforested area (Bamboo Village Uganda) to offset carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality.\n2. Replacing single-use plastic products with compostable plant-based alternatives, saving gallons of crude oil and petrochemicals annually.\n3. Developing a more sustainable product range for parents without any legislation on single-use plastic.\n4. Expanding horizons to address questions about end-of-life and circularity by receiving a Sustainability Grant from UoH and partnering with universities and commercial organizations to establish a nationwide sustainable end-of-life solution.",
