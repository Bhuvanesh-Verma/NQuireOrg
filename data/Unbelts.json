Some specific initiatives they have undertaken include using recycled and diverted materials throughout their supply chain, creating truly useful products that help repair the planet's environmental crisis, extending the lifetime of their products through free repairs and replacements, introducing recycled materials for their \"Intrepid\" secret pocket redesign, implementing consistent minimalist packaging across all product lines, investigating alternative sustainable materials, and developing a roadmap for carbon-neutral inbound and outbound shipping. Additionally, they are sewing imperfect but functional elastic into \"Almost Perfect\" belts and repurposing offcuts and imperfect elastic into \"Unbelts.\" These efforts demonstrate a strong commitment to environmental sustainability and responsible business practices.",

Additionally, the company seeks to establish partnerships with businesses owned by individuals facing systemic barriers, fostering a collaborative and inclusive community. Finally, the company aspires to become a leader in the Canadian fashion industry by promoting more B Corps and encouraging greater sustainability within the garment sector.
