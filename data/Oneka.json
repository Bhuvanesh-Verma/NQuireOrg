Building ethical recycling ecosystems in vulnerable coastal communities, contributing to stopping ocean plastic and improving lives.\n2.

Committing to removing three plastic bottles from coastlines for every 100ml of Oneka product purchased (whether online, at their store, or through retailers).\n4. Encouraging customers to adopt eco-friendly habits, such as reducing plastic consumption, using refills instead of single-use containers, and bringing reusable bags and containers when shopping.\n5. Providing free delivery for orders over $99 within Ontario and Quebec, and offering competitive rates for deliveries elsewhere in Canada and the US.\n6. Promoting awareness of the \"6Rs\" and encouraging individuals to adopt additional sustainability practices beyond the traditional \"reduce, reuse, recycle.\"",
