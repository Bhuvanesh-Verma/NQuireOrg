            "question": "What sustainable or environmental practices have been implemented?",
            "result": " Our Artisan Business Partners implement several sustainable and environmental practices across their various crafts. In textiles, they prioritize using natural dyes from locally sourced materials like flowers, berries, and bark for creating vibrant colors without relying on synthetic chemicals. Additionally, they utilize traditional weaving techniques that minimize material waste during production.\n\nIn jewelry making, the artisans opt for glass beads instead of metals, reducing the need for mining and processing raw materials associated with metal extraction. Furthermore, they employ small-scale production methods using tiny looms, which help conserve resources and reduce energy consumption compared to larger-scale industrial processes.",
