Additionally, students will have opportunities to troubleshoot issues, cover common mistakes, and explore different methods for setting yarn for specific uses. Throughout this process, participants will develop skills and knowledge related to spinning, plying, and using handspun yarns in their final projects. By bringing multiple small balls of yarn to class, students will have access to a variety of fibers and textures, further enhancing their understanding and appreciation of handspun yarns. Overall, the primary goal of these collaborative efforts is to provide a comprehensive educational experience that fosters creativity, skill development, and a deeper connection to the craft of spinning and textile artistry.",
