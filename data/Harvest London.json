            "result": " Harvest London, a vertical farm, has implemented several sustainable and environmental practices. They control the environment for optimal crop growth, using precise amounts of light, water, nutrients, and humidity. This method reduces the need for harmful pesticides and promotes healthier plants. Additionally, they focus on growing herbs and leafy greens that would otherwise require importation, thereby reducing the carbon footprint associated with long-distance shipping. By producing these items locally, they minimize food miles and decrease overall emissions related to transportation. Lastly, Harvest London has signed up to the SME Climate Commitment, demonstrating their dedication to creating a greener and more sustainable future for both their business and the planet.",
