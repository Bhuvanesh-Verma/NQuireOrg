Collaborative Research Projects: There are multiple research projects where Green Salon Collective works alongside individuals and organizations focused on long-term, target-driven tasks that produce new knowledge products or services improving the hair and beauty industry. Examples include Sanne's PhD exploring the limitations and innovation opportunities for using human hair waste as a material, and Stephanie's projects related to the environmental toll of disposable salon towels compared to traditional options like cotton and microfiber.\n2. Upscaling Human Hair Waste Usage: Green Salon Collective is collaborating with Natural Fibre Co., a British mill backed by the Rural Development Programme for England, to upscale the use of hair in yarn and rope. They are currently trialing a \"chunky\" yarn composed of salon hair waste blended with near-waste wool.\n3. Tree Planting and Re-Location Schemes: Green Salon Collective has contributed to tree planting efforts, with over 1,76 trees planted in 2, and co-funded a vole re-location scheme in Cornwall during the same year. These initiatives aim to support biodiversity and ecosystem restoration.\n4. Recycling Efforts: Green Salon Collective works closely with local businesses and organizations to ensure that all waste streams are converted into valuable resources. They have already diverted over 9 tons of salon waste from landfills and collected additional waste materials from industry events.\n5. B Corp Month and Impactful Solutions: March is recognized as B Corp month, and Green Salon Collective actively participates in promoting and sharing information about the benefits of becoming a B Corp. As a Best For The World B Corp\u2122 in Governance, Green Salon Collective continues to strive for greater social and environmental impact while maintaining transparency and legal accountability.",

Enhancing the circular economy within the hair and beauty industry through research and development (R&D) projects.\n2. Creating new knowledge products and services that measurably improve the industry.\n3. Better understanding the limitations and innovation opportunities related to using human hair waste as a material.\n4. Exploring alternative materials and practices for salon towels, such as traditional cotton and microfibre options.\n5. Developing sustainable alternatives to conventional salon towel materials, reducing the environmental impact of disposable towels.\n6. Upscaling the use of hair in yarn and rope, promoting the efficient utilization of hair waste and reducing landfill contributions.\n7. Expanding the application of hair felt projects, increasing awareness and adoption of sustainable materials and practices across the industry.\n8. Building strong connections between academia, industry partners, and communities to foster a more regenerative culture around hair recycling and circularity.\n9. Generating valuable insights into the hair and beauty industry through direct engagement with stakeholders, enabling better understanding of market needs and challenges.\n10. Encouraging active participation from community members in research initiatives, driving collective progress towards a more sustainable future for the hair and beauty sector.",
