            "result": " The mutual objectives and outcomes expected from these collaborations can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Collaboration between Eutopia Gestion and its co-investors in the \"Initiative Climat\" (IC20): This collaboration aims to achieve climate resilience for their investments while ensuring that the interests of Eutopia Gestion may not always align with those of all co-investors. By working together, they hope to reach a common understanding on sustainability issues and create positive repercussions for the development of their investments.\n2. Collaboration between Eutopia Gestion and its subsidiaries or affiliates: As a management company involved in capital investment, Eutopia Gestion works closely with other stakeholders, including shareholder participation funds, potential additional relevant parties, and other interested parties. This collaboration allows them to initiate targeted discussions, exchange ideas, and pool resources to address shared concerns, ultimately benefiting the participating shares and potentially driving business growth.\n3. Collaboration within the governance structure: Eutopia Gestion is committed to upholding professional ethical standards, such as those set forth by applicable regulatory bodies. Annually, the company revisits and updates its risk strategy, which must be approved by competent governing authorities. Among the key developments during the year, it is worth noting the launch of Eutopia Preferred Eutopia Co-Invest Tediber funds. Various governance and risk monitoring meetings were held according to the planned schedule.\n4. Collaboration with external service providers: Eutopia Gestion also works with various external service providers, such as auditors, legal advisors, and consultants, who help ensure compliance with applicable regulations and best practices. These collaborations enable Eutopia Gestion to maintain strong internal controls and risk management processes.\n5. Collaboration with employees: Finally, Eutopia Gestion encourages collaboration among its own employees when expressing themselves through media and social networks. They aim to promote responsible communication practices that foster a positive image and reputation for the company.",
