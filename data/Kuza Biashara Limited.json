Creating sustainable rural communities built on trust across Africa and South Asia (supporting community resilience and wellbeing).\n9. Transformatively scaling positive impacts through investments in people, processes, and digital technologies (ensuring continuous improvement and innovation).\n\nOverall, these collaborations aim to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes such as improved agricultural productivity, increased economic opportunity, strengthened social networks, and more sustainable rural communities.",
