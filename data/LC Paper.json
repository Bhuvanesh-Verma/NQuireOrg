Modifying process control software to monitor CO2 emissions in real-time.\n2. Recycling and reusing steam after paper drying, reducing energy consumption.\n3. Using alternative fibers with lower environmental footprint and fewer chemical products.\n4. Sourcing bio-gas from local farming facilities for generating steam.\n5. Patented cardboard packaging allowing doubling the items per truck, reducing transportation needs.\n6. Participating in various external audits and certifications (FSC, PEFC) ensuring responsible fiber sourcing.\n7. Implementing continuous improvement processes in energy efficiency.\n8. Generating heat/steam using residues collected from nearby forested areas affected by fire prevention efforts.\n9. Utilizing solar power for a portion of their energy needs.\n10.

By working with other companies, we seek operators for plant work under rotational shifts without requiring specific experience or academic titles. Positive prior experience in industrial environments will be valued. Candidates within close proximity will be prioritized.\n10. Similarly, we look for degree holders in mechanical engineering or related fields for support in production. Industrial experience will be valued positively, and candidates with backgrounds in industrial settings will be prioritized.\n11. For our electronics and mechatronics maintenance team, we prefer candidates with experience in industrial environments, where their expertise will be valued positively. Proximity to our facilities will also be considered during the selection process.\n12.
