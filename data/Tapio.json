Another example is the partnership between hubBrussels, Tapio, and various companies from the fashion industry. These collaborations aim to inspire actors within the fashion industry to reduce their environmental impact and become agents of change. Additionally, there is a partnership between BAVET (Belgian Association of Hotels, Restaurants, and Caf\u00e9s) and Tapio, which focuses on accelerating climate actions in the catering sector. Finally, the collaboration between the Royal L\u00e9opold Club (RLC), known as \"The L\u00e9o,\" and Tapio demonstrates how sports clubs can combine their passion for sports with climate dynamics by working together towards common goals.",

However, we can identify some general insights from the text. Firstly, the EY research highlights the significant financial advantages enjoyed by \"pacesetter\" companies that actively pursue climate change initiatives. These companies are 24 times more likely to report a higher financial value than those who do not engage in such efforts. Secondly, the CDP's Global Climate Change Analysis suggests that there is immense potential for businesses to generate substantial financial returns through sustainable practices. The study estimates that the potential value of sustainable business opportunities amounts to approximately $USD 21 trillion, which is nearly seven times greater than the costs required to realize these opportunities. Lastly, various studies and reports indicate that companies implementing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies tend to experience benefits, although these may not always directly address climate change issues. Overall, the key takeaway from the context is that embracing sustainable practices and climate change initiatives can lead to increased financial value and competitive advantage for forward-thinking organizations.",
