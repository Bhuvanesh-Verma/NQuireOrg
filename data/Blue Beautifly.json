            "result": " Based on the provided information, several sustainable and environmental practices have been implemented by Blue Beautifly. These include:\n\n1. Using dark blue glass bottles instead of plastic, which helps reduce plastic waste ending up in landfills, water treatment systems, oceans, and lakes. Glass has no adverse environmental impact even when disposed of improperly.\n2. The dark blue color of their containers blocks light that can accelerate product deterioration, thus extending the life of their products.\n3. Implementing a bottle buy-back program where they sanitize and sterilize used glass bottles for reuse, promoting circular economy and reducing the need for new glass production.\n4. Switching from cardboard boxes to 90 post-consumer Kraft paper envelopes for smaller orders within the US. This reduces packaging volume, weight, and materials used.\n5. Continuing to use cardboard boxes for international larger orders and customer requests while exploring ways to further minimize their environmental impact.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate Blue Beautifly's commitment to environmental, social, and ethical responsibility throughout their supply chain and operations.",
