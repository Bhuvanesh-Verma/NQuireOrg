            "result": " Ape2o has several sustainable and environmental practices in place. Some of these include:\n\n1. Donating 10% of profits from each sale to marine and freshwater conservation and cleanups. This directly supports organizations working to protect our oceans and waterways.\n2. Using a double-walled steel bottle instead of traditional single-use plastic bottles. Steel is infinitely recyclable, reducing waste and minimizing the need for new materials.\n3. Offering a limited edition bottle made from 10% recycled plastic bottles. This promotes circular economy principles and reduces reliance on virgin plastics.\n4. Partnering with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) to support their conservation efforts. Through this partnership, ape2o contributes to preserving marine and freshwater ecosystems.\n5. Achieving B Corporation status, which requires companies to prioritize planet and people alongside profit. This demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices.",
