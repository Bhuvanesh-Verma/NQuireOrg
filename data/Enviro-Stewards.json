Reducing their own environmental footprint by cutting emissions by 73 per employee through various in-house initiatives like reusing construction materials, doubling their office area, using low-flow toilets and faucets, and offsetting carbon and water use through sustainability credits.\n2. Installing a living wall to scrub CO2 from their office air, thereby reducing the need for heating or cooling and fresh air intake.\n3. Harvesting rainwater from their roof and storing it in a white tank for later use.\n4. Providing consultation, assessment, and implementation of practical and economically-feasible solutions to guide their clients towards long-term sustainable and financial success.",

Additionally, it states that the projects resulted in a reduction of approximately 32 tonnes of CO2e emissions per year.\n\n1. Resource savings: The text discusses the associated resource savings resulting from the implementation of the measures. These savings include conserved ingredients, products, water, electricity, and natural gas within the production facility and the supply chain. The combined economic savings were over $11 million annually, with an average payback period of only 12 months.\n\nThese metrics provide insight into the positive environmental impact of the assessments and initiatives undertaken by Enviro-Stewards and its clients.",
