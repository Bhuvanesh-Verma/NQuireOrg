Furthermore, they are certified as a B Corporation, which means they adhere to strict social and environmental performance standards, practice transparency, and hold themselves legally accountable for balancing profit and purpose. Lastly, they actively participate in fire recovery efforts and support local community wellness initiatives, such as the Community Wellness Center and programs focused on mental health and bilingual clinicians.",
