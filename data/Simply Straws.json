Some examples include using reusable straws (instead of disposable ones), reducing plastic waste, promoting low-waste living, supporting organizations like Surfrider Foundation, participating in community advocacy efforts, and encouraging upcycling. Additionally, the company behind the glass straw mentioned in the text appears to prioritize safety by warning users not to use damaged products. Overall, these practices demonstrate a commitment to minimizing environmental impact while also providing practical solutions for individuals seeking to live more sustainably.",
