Sourcing certified organic, shade-grown, fair trade Arabica coffee beans. This helps support ecologically sound agricultural practices and promote biodiversity.\n2. Donating at least 1% of each Salt Spring Coffee purchase to nonprofit environmental organizations and sustainability initiatives, focusing on organic farming and conservation efforts.\n3. Partnering with LOCO BC and participating in the Zero Hero program to reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions among local businesses.\n4. Accumulating and giving away burlap sacks and coffee chaff to local farmers and hobbyists for reuse on their properties.\n5. Working towards becoming a zero-waste management company, aiming to divert waste from landfills through recycling and organic processing.\n6. Identifying opportunities to replace non-sustainable materials with more eco-friendly alternatives (e.g., water-activated packing tape, commercially compostable gloves, and sustainable packaging).\n7. Encouraging customers to adopt zero-waste habits and sign up for newsletters to stay informed about their progress toward achieving zero waste.",

In March, B Corp Month and the anniversary of their own B Corp status (since 208) were celebrated. Being a B Corp has driven the company towards greater sustainability and social awareness.\n2. Consumers may not yet fully understand the significance of the B Corp certification, leading Salt Spring Coffee to emphasize their commitment to social and environmental performance, transparency, and legal accountability.\n3. The company continues to strengthen its relationships with suppliers who share their dedication to sustainability and quality.\n4. Salt Spring Coffee remains committed to improving the wellbeing of its team members, fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace culture, and promoting safety.\n5. As an independent, purpose-driven company, Salt Spring Coffee recognizes its responsibility to contribute positively to society and the environment while maintaining profitability.\n6. While the company's focus on organic and fair trade certifications is commendable, the B Corp certification extends beyond product offerings to encompass the entire organization, including business practices, employee treatment, and community impact.\n7. Through the rigor of the B Corp certification process and triennial renewals, Salt Spring Coffee has embedded the B Corp mindset into its decision-making processes, resulting in increased accountability and progress tracking.",
