One notable example is the annual B Corp Retreat, where both B Corps and Do Nation come together to discuss, collaborate, and celebrate their collective efforts towards creating positive social and environmental impact through business practices. Additionally, B Corps often participate in Do Nation's pledge challenges, such as the recent \"B Inspired\" challenge, where employees from B Corps committed to taking specific actions related to climate change and sustainability. Finally, there might also be individual partnerships between specific B Corps and Do Nation, focused on particular projects or initiatives.",
