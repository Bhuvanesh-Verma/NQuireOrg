Employee ownership: PV Squared is a worker-owned cooperative, which means employees have a direct stake in the success of both the business and the local environment.\n2. Renewable energy solutions: As a solar installation company, PV Squared provides renewable energy solutions to homeowners and businesses in Western Massachusetts. These installations reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources and contribute to cleaner air and lower carbon emissions.\n3. Green building projects: PV Squared has collaborated on multiple Living Building Challenge projects, including the installation of solar arrays at Smith College and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment. These projects prioritize sustainability, resource efficiency, and ecological responsibility in their designs and operations.\n\nAdditionally, it can be inferred that PV Squared itself employs sustainable business practices, given its commitment to creating stable, long-term jobs, using sustainable materials, and being strongly connected with and accountable to the local community.",

Annual environmental offset: The installation of solar systems can result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. For example, it is mentioned that the  kW solar system installed in Greenfield will account for an annual environmental offset of  metric tons of CO2. This is equivalent to the amount of CO2 emitted by burning  pounds of coal or consuming 47 gallons of gasoline.\n\n1. Environmental offsets per year: Another metric mentioned is the amount of CO2 emissions that will be offset annually by different solar installations. For instance, it is stated that the  kW PV system installed for Bostwick Gardens is estimated to offset  pounds of CO2 per year. This is equivalent to the CO2 emissions from burning 6 gallons of gasoline and 62 pounds of coal.",
