This partnership enables more buyers to participate in the market and increases the overall demand for clean energy. Another significant partnership mentioned is between SCEGL and its \"generator\" partners, who produce clean energy from sources like wind, solar, and hydro plants. These partnerships help facilitate the sale of clean energy to SCEGL's buyer consortium members. Additionally, SCEGL works closely with other stakeholders in the renewable energy industry, including regulatory bodies, technology providers, and NGOs focused on promoting sustainable energy solutions. Overall, these partnerships and collaborations contribute to creating a thriving market for clean energy and driving positive change within the business sector.",
