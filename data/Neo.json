            "result": " Throughout the process described, several sustainable and environmentally-focused practices have been put in place. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. Removing individual waste bins under employees' desks and encouraging them to use shared recycling areas instead. This promoted better waste separation and reduced the amount of non-recyclable material going to landfill.\n2. Creating a nature-friendly terrace outside the office building in Brighton. This provided a green space for both humans and wildlife, while also promoting community bonding and enhancing overall wellbeing.\n3. Implementing a 'Care Without Carbon' management plan aimed at reducing the trust's carbon footprint and prioritizing sustainability throughout its operations.\n4. Partnering with organizations such as Sustrans and B Corps to further promote sustainable transportation and responsible business practices.\n5. Committing to using only ethical, sustainable suppliers across all aspects of the organization's operations, including energy providers, insurers, and even coffee and tea vendors.",
