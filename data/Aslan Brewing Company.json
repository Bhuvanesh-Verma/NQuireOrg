Using filtered water from their brewery for garden irrigation, helping to reduce stormwater runoff and improve local water quality.\n2. Being a Downtown Improvement Garden Steward, contributing to urban green spaces and supporting local ecosystems.\n3. Utilizing rainwater harvesting by directing water from their roof into storage tanks for later use in irrigation and other non-potable applications.\n4. Purchasing Water Restoration Certificates through the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, ensuring that the water they consume is accounted for and funds restoration projects across the country.\n5. Introducing a plastic film recycling program as part of their commitment to reducing waste and promoting circular economy principles.",
