World Wildlife Day (March 3) - Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 203, this day celebrates and raises awareness about the world's wild animals and plants. Various events and campaigns are held globally.\n3. International Day for Biological Diversity (May 22) - Organized by the Convention on Biological Diversity, this day promotes understanding and conservation of biological diversity, including genetic resources, ecosystems, and cultural diversity.\n4. World Environment Day (June 5) - Hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), this global event encourages worldwide awareness and action for the protection of the environment.\n5. Global Climate Strike (September) - A series of worldwide strikes led by young activists demanding immediate action on climate change. The strikes aim to pressure governments and corporations to adopt more ambitious climate policies.\n6. COP26 (November/December) - The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
