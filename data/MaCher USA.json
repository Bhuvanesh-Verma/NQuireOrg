These stages typically include material extraction, materials processing, manufacturing, shipping/distribution, use, and end-of-life. The most common impact category assessed by an LCA study is the carbon footprint, which accounts for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (reported as CO2e) released during the product's life cycle. However, LCAs can also consider additional impact categories, such as water impact, biodiversity impact, and social impact. By analyzing these calculations, businesses can better understand how to improve efficiency and identify areas where they can take action to mitigate environmental impacts.",
