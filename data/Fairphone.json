One significant development is the reduction of child labor, which has opened up spaces for children to access education and other learning opportunities. Additionally, the project has contributed to improvements in healthcare, infrastructure, and environmental management, creating potential job openings in these fields. Furthermore, the increased attention to health and safety in the mine has likely resulted in training programs and skill development initiatives for miners, potentially leading to improved employment prospects within the mining industry. Finally, the emphasis on local hiring and investments in education suggests that there may be opportunities for locals to gain skills and knowledge relevant to the mine operations and related industries.",

Limited-time discounts: During periods of financial constraint (e.g., December), Fairphone offers limited-time discounts on its products, allowing customers to save money while supporting ethical practices in the electronics industry.\n5. Responsible sourcing: By using Fairmined gold in their products, Fairphone supports small-scale miners through the provision of Fairmined premiums, ensuring fair compensation and upholding high standards of responsible production.\n6.
