The text mentions instances where the community came together to support local charities, such as providing food for animals in shelters, removing carbon dioxide through tree planting, and supporting organizations like OzHarvest and the Indigenous Literacy Foundation. Additionally, the community has shown solidarity with marginalized groups facing challenges like breast cancer, homelessness, and congenital heart disease.
