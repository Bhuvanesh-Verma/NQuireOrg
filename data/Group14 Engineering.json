            "result": " The text mentions several sustainable or environmental practices that have been implemented by Group14. These include:\n\n1. Integrated design approach: This leads to more efficient, high-performing buildings through the use of cost-effective sustainable design and construction strategies.\n2. Strategy development: Group14 assists organizations in measuring their internal practices and guides them on achieving their environmental goals. They also provide Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) services to help organizations improve and report on their sustainability efforts.\n3. Life-cycle assessments (LCAs): Group14 specializes in conducting these assessments to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with all phases of a building's life cycle, from extraction to decommissioning. LCAs can inform design and construction decisions based on scientific evidence.\n4. Organizational resilience and resilient design strategies: Group14 focuses on preserving the value of building assets and managing risks related to climate change vulnerabilities.\n5. Arts & Culture projects: When working with cultural organizations, Group14 promotes lower operating costs, improved air quality, and environmentally friendly designs that showcase the organization's commitment to sustainability. Examples include the Denver Botanic Gardens and the Denver Art Museum.\n6. Water conservation: One specific example mentioned is the installation of water-efficient flow and flush fixtures in five buildings, resulting in a cumulative annual savings of 35 million gallons of water.",
