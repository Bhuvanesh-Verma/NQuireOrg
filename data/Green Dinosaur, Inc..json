Reducing the burden on the landfill by diverting and recycling over 77 of the demolition/construction waste.\n2. Using environmentally preferable building materials and low VOC products.\n3. Implementing high-efficiency lighting to conserve energy.\n4. Designing landscaping with a high-efficiency drip irrigation system and no conventional turf.\n5. Installing high-efficiency HVAC systems for optimal energy performance, along with efficient domestic hot water and envelope optimization.\n6. Employing quality air sealing and insulation installation to minimize envelope leakage and HVAC loads.\n7. A net zero energy carbon neutral project that meets and exceeds challenge targets with a projected annual EUI of 0 kBtu. This includes implementing a PV system to offset all site energy use, using high-efficiency heat pump water heaters coupled with solar thermal pre-heat, and incorporating stormwater quality infiltration features to protect waterways and replenish the aquifer.",

Stormwater management: Capturing and treating stormwater onsite to prevent it from entering local waterways and becoming polluted. This helps protect water resources and maintain water quality.\n2. Water conservation: Using high-efficiency plumbing fixtures and other strategies to reduce water usage, thereby conserving this valuable resource and lowering demand on municipal water supplies.\n3. Landfill diversion: Diverting and recycling construction and demolition waste, reducing the amount sent to landfills and promoting circular economy practices.\n4. Energy production and consumption: Utilizing renewable energy sources (PV and solar thermal systems) to offset the use of fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy generation. Additionally, optimizing energy performance in mid-rise buildings to achieve significant energy savings compared to typical standards.\n5. Air quality: Implementing comprehensive air sealing and insulation measures to minimize envelope leakage and reduce the load on HVAC systems, leading to improved indoor air quality and reduced reliance on mechanical ventilation systems.\n6. Material selection: Choosing environmentally preferable building materials and low-VOC products to promote healthier indoor environments and reduce the overall environmental footprint of the project.\n7. Heat island effect mitigation: Providing shaded parking areas under carports to help reduce the urban heat island effect, improving outdoor thermal comfort and potentially reducing cooling demands on nearby buildings.\n8. Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensuring that all ground-floor units meet ADA requirements, making the development more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities.",
