            "result": " Based on the provided information, I cannot provide a definitive list of all the sustainable or environmental practices implemented by Avenue. However, there are some hints scattered throughout the text that suggest certain practices. For instance, the organization has adopted a remote work setup, which helps reduce carbon emissions due to commuting. Additionally, they have offset their carbon footprint by purchasing carbon offsets from Terrapass. Furthermore, they have contributed over 4 hours of board service, demonstrating their commitment to supporting other organizations focused on creating positive change. Finally, they have taken steps to conserve energy and resources, such as reducing miles driven and gas consumption as a remote company. While these examples do not represent an exhaustive list of all their sustainable or environmental practices, they do give us insight into some of the initiatives Avenue has undertaken.",
