By doing so, the risks associated with the business will be distributed among multiple owners, potentially increasing the overall upside while mitigating bottlenecks caused by having only two individuals controlling key decision-making levers. Additionally, the co-op model may serve as a replicable example for other similar businesses facing similar challenges. Ultimately, the desired outcome of these collaborations is to create a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive business model that benefits both the employees and the wider community.",
