However, some general observations can be made regarding their efforts towards creating more equitable, just, and resilient food systems. These include:\n\n1. Transitioning from pre-cooked or processed foods to scratch-cooked meals, which reduces reliance on packaged goods and supports local economies.\n2. Engaging in local sourcing, which minimizes transportation emissions and supports nearby farmers and producers.\n3. Adopting zero-waste strategies, such as composting and reducing food waste, which helps conserve resources and reduce landfill contributions to climate change.\n4. Prioritizing equity and social justice within their food systems work, which acknowledges the importance of ensuring that marginalized communities have equal access to healthy, affordable, and culturally appropriate foods.",
