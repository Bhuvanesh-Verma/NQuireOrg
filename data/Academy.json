These events aim to foster connections among students, staff, and alumni while promoting shared experiences and growth. Some examples include:\n\n1. Daily Stand-Ups: Students gather every morning to discuss their progress, share challenges, and celebrate achievements. This daily ritual helps create a sense of unity and accountability within the group.\n2. Weekly Retrospectives: At the end of each week, students come together to reflect on their experiences, identify areas for improvement, and set goals for the coming week. This process encourages continuous self-reflection and personal growth.\n3. People Skills Sessions: Throughout the course, students participate in workshops designed to enhance their interpersonal communication and collaboration skills. By focusing on these soft skills, the community becomes stronger and better equipped to collaborate on projects and support one another.\n4. Creative Coding Workshops: In addition to teaching traditional programming concepts, the curriculum also includes sessions on creative coding techniques. These workshops encourage students to explore new ways of thinking about coding and to express themselves creatively.\n5. Social Events: From informal gatherings like game nights and movie nights to larger celebrations like graduation ceremonies, the Full Stack Web Application Development course organizes various social events throughout the year. These occasions provide opportunities for students to relax, unwind, and bond with their peers outside of the classroom setting.",
