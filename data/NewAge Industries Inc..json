            "result": " Throughout their history, NewAge Industries has consistently demonstrated their commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. Some notable practices they have implemented include:\n\n1. Solar Power: For over six years, NewAge has utilized a solar power system with over 4,00 panels generating approximately one megawatt of electricity per year. This clean and sustainable energy source significantly reduces their reliance on traditional fossil fuels.\n2. Zero Waste Initiative: NewAge has successfully transformed into a zero-waste organization by diverting all waste from landfills. They achieve this through various methods like recycling, repurposing materials, and participating in local waste management programs. Additionally, any non-recyclable waste is transported to an Energy-from-Waste (EfW) facility where metals are extracted and recycled, while the remaining waste is converted into energy through steam and electricity generation.\n3. Electric Vehicle Charging Station: As part of their ongoing efforts to promote sustainable transportation, NewAge has installed a Level 2 electric vehicle charging station. This station can accommodate two vehicles simultaneously and plans for additional stations are in place to meet future demand.\n4. Renovations & Upgrades: During building renovations, NewAge has implemented numerous sustainable practices, including improving insulation, installing high-efficiency lighting systems, and incorporating water conservation measures. These upgrades contribute to reduced energy consumption and overall resource efficiency.",

Additionally, it appears that NewAge plans to continue expanding their operations through acquisitions and facility expansions. For instance, they recently purchased a second facility within seven miles of their corporate headquarters, further increasing their production capabilities. Furthermore, the company has shown dedication to sustainability initiatives and alternative energy sources, such as installing solar panels on their headquarters.
