            "result": " During the COP26 conference, several sustainable and environmental practices were implemented to minimize the event's ecological footprint. Some of these practices include using locally sourced Mara Seaweed as a sustainable substitute for salt in the served dishes; providing reusable aluminum water bottles to participants; utilizing low-carbon alternative energy sources such as electric and low-emission vehicles; employing solar energy for temporary traffic lights and using Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) in generators instead of diesel fuel. Additionally, the conference emphasized the importance of protecting forests, with numerous governments, companies, and organizations pledging to take action towards more sustainable agricultural practices and investing in scientific research to safeguard global food supplies against climate change.",
