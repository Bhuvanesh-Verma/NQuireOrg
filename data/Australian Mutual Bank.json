Extension of expiration dates for \"Dine & Discover NSW\" vouchers: This benefit allows residents aged 18 and over to use their remaining vouchers until June 30th, giving them more opportunities to support small businesses in the food, arts, and recreation sectors.\n2. Additional vouchers for eligible NSW residents: Those who were initially allocated four $25 vouchers each (two for \"Dine\" and two for \"Discover\") will receive an additional two vouchers each (one for \"Dine\" and another for \"Discover\"), bringing the total number of vouchers per person to six $25 vouchers.\n3. Encouragement to support local businesses during the summer break: By extending the validity period of the vouchers and providing additional vouchers, the government hopes to motivate residents to utilize these benefits and support small businesses in need.",

These partnerships aim to achieve shared goals related to community development, social welfare, environmental sustainability, and financial inclusion. Some specific examples include:\n\n1. Supporting vulnerable communities: Collaborations such as the one between AMB and Barnardos Australia help improve the lives of disadvantaged individuals and families through projects like refurbishing offices and providing volunteering opportunities. This contributes to creating stronger, more resilient communities.\n2. Financial literacy and education: By supporting initiatives like the Reconnect program run by Barnardos Australia, AMB and other partners can help empower individuals and communities with essential financial skills and knowledge. This leads to better economic decision-making and increased financial stability.\n3. Promoting climate action: The collaboration between AMF and ACCU focuses on addressing climate change issues, particularly in the areas of education and advocacy. Together, they hope to inspire credit unions and cooperatives worldwide to take meaningful steps towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n4. Strengthening cooperative networks: Partnerships like the one between AMF and ACCU foster connections among cooperative institutions, enabling them to share knowledge, resources, and best practices. This ultimately helps to build stronger, more resilient cooperative structures that can better serve their members and communities.\n5. Encouraging responsible business practices: By engaging in collaborative efforts, organizations like AMB and Barnardos Australia demonstrate their commitment to ethical decision-making, corporate social responsibility, and promoting a sense of unity within the broader community.",
