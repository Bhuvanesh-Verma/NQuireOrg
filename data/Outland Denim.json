Regenerative farming: This practice focuses on improving the landscape to encourage a greater level of biodiversity, providing a more eco-friendly operation and a more sustainable business.\n2. Restoration of ecological balance: By reintroducing trees and foliage, pastoralists can improve water retention, support native animal regeneration, and enhance carbon capture capabilities.\n3. Addressing environmental impact: Outland has integrated the consideration of environmental impact into its design process, ensuring that sustainability is not just about social and economic factors, but also about minimizing the brand's overall environmental footprint.\n4. Use of organic materials: The message mentions the potential benefits of using fully organic materials and sustainable materials at scale, as they tend to be less emissions-intensive than conventional alternatives.",
