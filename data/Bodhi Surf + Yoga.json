            "result": " Bodhi Surf + Yoga has implemented numerous sustainable and environmental practices. Some of these initiatives include:\n\n1. Reducing plastic usage and implementing alternative solutions (e.g., Klean Kanteen bottles).\n2. Implementing a comprehensive recycling program, including measuring and monitoring recycling production monthly.\n3. Encouraging staff and guests to use reusable products, such as water bottles and food containers.\n4. Aiming to reduce operational transportation costs by promoting carpooling, biking, walking, and using electric vehicles when possible.\n5. Utilizing repurposed materials for furniture and decorations, such as building benches from old surfboards.\n6. Maintaining lush, green gardens that help absorb water and maintain a cooler temperature.\n7. Employing environmentally-friendly gardening techniques, including organic pest control methods.\n8. Operating a compost system to minimize food waste.\n9. Offering a custom plastic and fiberglass-free swimming pool, which reduces energy consumption and pollution associated with traditional pool construction and maintenance.\n10. Partnering with Native Energy to calculate and offset their carbon footprint, resulting in becoming carbon neutral. Additionally, they created a Carbon Travel Calculator to encourage guests to purchase their own offsets for flights.",

            "result": " There are several key partnerships or collaborations related to commerce that aim to create positive social and environmental impacts. Some examples include:\n\n1. B Corp Movement: The B Corp movement brings together businesses, governments, and consumers to create a more socially and environmentally responsible business landscape. By certifying companies as B Corps, they commit to meeting high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.\n2. Benefit Corporation Legislation: Governments can pass Benefit Corporation legislation, allowing companies to prioritize social and environmental goals alongside financial success. These laws enable businesses to \"do well while doing good,\" fostering collaboration between the private sector and public policy makers.\n3. Consumer Choice & Voting With Dollars: Consumers play a crucial role in driving positive change through their purchasing decisions. By choosing to support businesses that prioritize social and environmental responsibility, consumers can use their buying power to influence market trends and encourage collaboration among businesses committed to creating a better future.\n4. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Collaboration between government agencies and private sector entities can lead to PPPs that address pressing social and environmental challenges. These partnerships leverage the strengths of both sectors to develop innovative solutions and drive systemic change.\n5. Industry Associations & Initiatives: Trade associations and other industry-specific groups can facilitate collaboration among businesses within a particular sector. Through joint initiatives and advocacy efforts, these organizations can promote best practices and drive progress towards shared goals related to social and environmental responsibility.",
