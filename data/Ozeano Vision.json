            "result": " Throughout the provided text, there are several sustainable or environmental practices that have been implemented by Ozeano. These include:\n\n1. Achieving carbon-neutrality by calculating the CO2 emissions generated by their products and accessing them in order to be able to offset their carbon footprint. They work with Green Story to conduct life cycle analysis of their entire supply chains.\n2. Partnering with Green Story to undertake rigorous life cycle analysis of their entire supply chains in order to calculate the CO2 emissions generated by their products and access them in order to be able to offset their carbon footprint.\n3. Using recyclable, renewable, and biodegradable materials such as plant-based bio-acetate pouches, GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified organic cotton cloth, and home-compostable courier bags with biodegradable tape.\n4. Sourcing materials from suppliers who adhere to strict environmental and ethical standards.\n5. Supporting reforestation, renewable energy, and community projects to offset their carbon footprint.\n6. Donating 6% from each purchase of Ozeano sunglasses (excluding wholesale) to fund the operation of 1 Seabin units to remove 6 kg of plastic and marine litter from our oceans and waterways.\n7. Being a certified B Corporation, which means they undergo regular assessments to maintain high social and environmental performance standards.\n8. Using eco-friendly shipping materials like recycled and recyclable kraft with environmentally-friendly ultraviolet ink for shipping packaging.\n9. Prioritizing handmade, built-to-last environmentally-friendly products that stand the test of time without costing the Earth.",

As a result, this partnership aims to reduce plastic pollution in the world's waters, promoting a healthier marine ecosystem and preserving biodiversity.\n\nThe second case describes a joint effort between two companies, Karadere Wind Power Project and Hydrologic, to develop sustainable energy solutions in Turkey. Their objective is to harness the country's wind energy potential while minimizing environmental impacts and fostering local economic development. Through this collaboration, they aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, promote clean and renewable energy sources, and contribute to global efforts against climate change.
