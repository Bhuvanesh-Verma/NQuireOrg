One notable example is the mention of \"regenerative agriculture\" during the trip to Jocot\u00e1n. This type of farming focuses on improving soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity while also increasing yields. Additionally, the text discusses using innovative materials that are better for the environment, such as those made from recycled cotton or PET. However, it is mentioned that these materials may not yet be widely available due to production limitations. Overall, Wakami appears to be committed to implementing sustainable practices across various aspects of their business, including material sourcing, community development, and market transformation.",
