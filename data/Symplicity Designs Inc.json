However, we can infer some general ideas from their mission and values. They aim to inspire improvement and innovation in businesses, governments, and communities while focusing on people, planet, and profit. This suggests that they might be promoting environmentally friendly practices within these organizations. Additionally, as a partner in Symplicity for over 10 years, Matt has helped numerous organizations recover from difficult situations, including those related to environmental challenges. Overall, although there isn't a direct mention of specific sustainability practices, it can be assumed that they are committed to promoting eco-friendly initiatives in the organizations they work with.",
