            "result": " From the given text, it can be inferred that Helioz presents simple tips and tricks on how to include sustainability in everyday business. One of the mentioned tips is proper cooling/heating in buildings. It is stated that in Austria, about one-third of carbon emissions are caused by buildings, primarily due to electricity and gas consumption. To promote sustainability, it is suggested to invest in appropriate window insulation and curtains instead of constantly running the air conditioning or heating system. Additionally, it is recommended to maintain proper ventilation, switch off lights when not needed, and encourage employees to adopt eco-friendly habits like using reusable cups and containers. These actions contribute towards reducing energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions, thereby promoting sustainability.",

Firstly, the ecological footprint describes how much biocapacity (air, soil, water, etc.) is required for one human being. Secondly, SODIS (Solution of Iodine Deficiency Orchestrated by Sunlight) is a water disinfection process based on UV-A radiation in sunlight, which has been recommended by WHO as an effective water treatment method at the household level. Thirdly, voluntary offsetting involves calculating the amount of remaining climate-impacting emissions from a particular activity, followed by emission reduction credits (also known as carbon credits), which can be traded. Finally, the development of methodologies like the Gold Standard ensures clear documentation of CO2 savings in India, which are verified by independent auditors and administered on platforms like the Environmental Registry of the HIS Markit.",

Additionally, HELIOZ benefits from the diverse backgrounds and experiences of its team members, which contribute to the company's ability to identify and address societal issues through innovative projects like WADI. On the other hand, the board member representing the KMU (small and medium-sized enterprise) sector brings valuable insights into the challenges faced by smaller companies. This collaboration helps ensure that HELIOZ remains responsive to the needs of all types of clients, including those from the KMU sector.
