Some examples include Earth Hour, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) events, Greenpeace actions, and the annual conference of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Supplier partnerships: Companies often form partnerships with suppliers to ensure a steady supply of raw materials, components, or finished goods. Strong relationships with suppliers can help reduce costs, improve product quality, and ensure timely delivery.\n2. Distribution partnerships: Retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers often partner with distributors to expand their reach and distribute their products to customers across multiple regions or countries.\n3. Joint ventures: Two or more companies may form a joint venture to collaborate on specific projects or to enter new markets. Joint ventures can help both parties share risks, pool resources, and leverage each other's strengths.\n4. Cross-sector partnerships: Companies sometimes partner with organizations from different sectors to develop innovative solutions, address social or environmental issues, or access new markets. For example, a technology company might partner with a nonprofit organization to develop a sustainable solution for a community problem.\n5. Research and development (R&D) partnerships: Companies may collaborate with academic institutions, research labs, or other companies to conduct R&D activities. Such partnerships can help drive technological advancements, foster innovation, and support the development of new products or services.\n6. Marketing and promotional partnerships: Brands may partner with other brands, influencers, or events to promote their products or services through co-branded campaigns, sponsorships, or exclusive offers.\n7.
