One example is the relationship between Certified B Corporations (B Corps) and their customers. By working together, both parties can achieve a common goal while creating a positive impact. Another collaboration involves Ontario farmers, food producers, and businesses committed to creating a viable local food system. They work together to share resources, knowledge, and expertise, ultimately benefiting the community and the environment. Additionally, there may be partnerships between chefs, restaurants, and food producers focused on promoting sustainability and education around sustainable eating habits. Finally, various organizations and initiatives, such as Sustainuary, bring together different stakeholders including producers, chefs, and consumers to address pressing issues in the food system and drive positive change.",
