Environmental Justice and Human Rights: Acknowledgment of the importance of addressing environmental issues alongside human rights.\n2. Economic recovery: Despite being in the third year of the pandemic, the economy is still recovering, albeit slowly. Unemployment rates remain high, but there are signs of improvement in terms of wage growth and job opportunities.\n3. Long Expansionary Period: Federal Reserve Chairman Powell acknowledges that allowing the economy to \"run hot\" for longer periods benefits a wider segment of the population. This suggests a focus on economic growth and stability.\n4. Shareholder Activism: An emphasis on promoting social change through shareholder activism, focusing on areas such as environmental conservation and regeneration.\n\nWhile there may not be a comprehensive list of 10 events specifically dedicated to environmental conservation, these points highlight the ongoing efforts to address environmental concerns and promote sustainability within the context of the broader economic and social landscape.",
