            "result": " There are several sustainable and environmentally friendly practices mentioned throughout the text. Some key points include:\n\n1. Recycling soap through the \"Ecosoap Bank\" model, which reduces landfill waste and provides soap to people in need.\n2. Partnering with organizations such as Clean the World Foundation (CTWF) to produce safety-certified, eco-friendly soap bars made from scrap soap. These soap bars are then distributed to various organizations, including homeless shelters, food pantries, schools, and health clinics across the United States.\n3. Working with partners in countries like Honduras, where they combat poverty by providing educational and career opportunities to locals.\n4. Collaborating with Sundara, another international aid partner, whose soapmaking model employs women who wouldn't otherwise have a stable source of income.\n5. Supporting local economies through their sustainability model, ensuring they contribute positively to the communities they serve.\n6. Engaging in efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, such as optimizing their impact while minimizing costs associated with raw materials.",
