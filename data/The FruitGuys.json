            "result": " There are several sustainable or environmental practices mentioned throughout these passages. Some key examples include:\n\n1. The Fruitguys focusing on environmental sustainability and supporting nonprofit farm projects for sustainable agriculture.\n2. Cattail Organics implementing various eco-friendly practices such as using reusable landscape fabric, a small walk-behind cultivator, and a floating row cover to protect plants from wind and cold, as well as insects and diseases. These practices help reduce inputs, increase profitability, and minimize negative environmental impacts.\n3. Enviro-Stewards taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint, including installing an integrated living wall in their ventilation system, which helps remove CO2 from the air. They also upgraded their office ventilation system to improve indoor air quality while conserving energy.\n4. Enviro-Stewards committing to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per employee by 80%, achieving this goal by implementing energy conservation measures that reduced emissions by 73 per employee. Additionally, they offset twice the remaining emissions associated with their facilities, as reported in the \"Sustainable Waterloo Region\" report.",

            "result": " In the provided text, several environmental impact metrics are mentioned or discussed. These include:\n\n1. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions: Both Enviro-Stewards and The Fruitguys discuss GHG emissions related to their operations. Enviro-Stewards mention that their engineering services helped their clients avoid over 10 tonnes of GHG for each development project, while also highlighting their own efforts to reduce their remaining GHG emissions. On the other hand, The Fruitguys emphasize their commitment to environmental sustainability and their efforts to minimize their carbon footprint.\n\n1. Energy efficiency: Several instances showcase the importance of energy efficiency in mitigating environmental impacts. Examples include reducing exhaust rates to save energy and implementing integrated living walls in ventilation systems to remove CO2 and potentially reduce the need for additional makeup air.\n\n1. Carbon footprint reduction: Companies such as The Fruitguys aim to minimize their carbon footprint, indicating a focus on greenhouse gas emissions. This aligns with broader efforts to combat climate change and promote environmental sustainability.",
