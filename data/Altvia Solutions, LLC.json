However, limited partners (LPs) often receive regular updates from general partners (GPs) via letters, presentations, and data rooms. These communications may include information on portfolio company performance, progress towards strategic objectives, and any changes in management or ownership structures. Additionally, some GPs participate in industry conferences and events where they share insights and updates on their investments. Overall, while there isn't a formalized annual or quarterly report structure, GPs generally maintain open lines of communication with their LPs to ensure transparency and collaboration throughout the investment process.",
