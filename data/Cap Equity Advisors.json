            "question": "What sustainable or environmental practices have been implemented?",
            "result": " Throughout the passage, there are multiple examples of sustainable or environmental practices that have been implemented by CapEquity Advisors Ltd and its partners. Some key initiatives include:\n\n1. Carbon-neutral organization: CapEquity runs a carbon-neutral operation, actively reducing their carbon footprint and offsetting any remaining emissions. They are currently carbon-negative, meaning they are removing more CO2 than they produce.\n2. Monitoring and managing waste, travel, and energy usage: The company focuses on these three priority areas to minimize their environmental impact. Measures taken may include maximizing digital alternatives to physical travel, promoting alternative transportation methods like carpooling or public transit, and encouraging employees to adopt eco-friendly habits both inside and outside the workplace.\n3. Supporting environmental best practices: CapEquity advocates for and supports their employees in pursuing environmental excellence beyond their professional roles. By doing so, they contribute to a broader culture of sustainability and encourage individual actions that can collectively make a difference.\n4. Commitment to continuous improvement: CapEquity is dedicated to regularly reviewing and updating their environmental commitments each year. This proactive approach ensures that they remain responsive to changing needs and stay ahead of regulatory requirements.\n5. Investment in green energy projects: CapEquity has joined forces with Ecologi to fund six innovative green energy projects around the world. These projects range from capturing methane gas in Brazil to distributing fuel-efficient cookstoves in Tanzania. Each initiative contributes to reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy sources, and improving local livelihoods and environments.",
