However, based on the information provided, it seems that the focus is on understanding the overall social and environmental impact of suppliers, particularly in relation to each other. This includes looking at aspects like GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3), embodied \"zombie\" carbon, and supporting keystone species. Additionally, the projects aim to identify areas of concern and improvement within the supply chain, ultimately leading to better decision-making and resource allocation towards creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly business operation.",

Firstly, Alison and Emmy discuss the importance of providing comprehensive employee benefits packages, including home ownership opportunities and access to renewable energy sources. This emphasizes the value placed on employees' wellbeing and sustainability. Secondly, during the conversation with Shawn Berry, the topic of building a strong company culture comes up. This suggests that creating a supportive environment where employees feel comfortable taking risks and learning from failure is highly valued. Lastly, when talking about worker ownership models such as cooperatives, Ryan Honeyman mentions the potential benefits for workers, including increased job security, shared decision-making, and greater financial returns. These benefits demonstrate a commitment to fostering inclusivity, fairness, and empowerment within the workplace.",
