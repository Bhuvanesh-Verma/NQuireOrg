However, specific targets for the \"next period\" cannot be directly inferred from the given text. Some general observations regarding potential future goals include:\n\n1. Prudential Financial plans to grant money through their program to seed the Stackwell investment accounts of up to  students within the Student Freedom Initiative Network. This could potentially involve significant funding over time.\n2. Women In Trucking aims to recognize industry leaders like Ryder's efforts in fostering a more gender-inclusive workforce. While not explicitly related to funding, such recognition may lead to increased partnerships and opportunities for funding in the future.\n3. Always Period Heroes distributed millions of pads to fight period poverty in local communities. It is possible that they might aim to expand their reach and distribution further, which would require additional funding.\n4. Patagonia has been leading the way in sustainable fashion for decades. Although they represent only a fraction of the fashion industry, they continue to push for positive changes and innovations. Their future growth and expansion could depend on securing adequate funding.\n5. Walmart and Sustainable Beef LLC plan to increase visibility in the beef supply chain and help ranchers grow their businesses. This collaboration may result in joint funding opportunities to support their shared goals.\n6. SustainLife received seed funding from a co-led round by Tapestry VC and Jetcom co-founder Mike Hanrahan. They intend to use these funds to accelerate their hiring, software development, and customer acquisition efforts. As they progress, they may seek additional rounds of funding to support their continued growth.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't a direct mention of financial or funding goals for the next period, several organizations mentioned in the context have ongoing projects or initiatives that may require funding in the future.",
