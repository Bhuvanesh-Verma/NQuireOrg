            "result": " There are several key partnerships or collaborations related to commerce that aim to create positive social change while still generating profits. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives: Many large corporations engage in CSR programs to address social and environmental issues. Through these initiatives, companies work with nonprofit organizations, governments, and other stakeholders to promote sustainability, support local communities, and contribute to broader social causes.\n2. Public-private partnerships (PPPs): PPPs involve collaboration between public sector entities and private sector companies to deliver public services or infrastructure projects. By combining resources and expertise, these partnerships aim to achieve common goals such as improving public health, education, transportation, and urban development.\n3. Impact investing: Impact investors allocate capital to businesses and organizations with the intention of generating both financial returns and measurable social or environmental benefits. Collaborative efforts among impact investors, entrepreneurs, and intermediary organizations facilitate the growth of socially responsible businesses and drive positive change.\n4. Supplier diversity programs: Companies often establish supplier diversity programs to foster relationships with minority-, women-, veteran-, or LGBTQ+-owned businesses. These partnerships not only promote inclusiveness and economic opportunity but also enable larger companies to access innovative products and services from diverse suppliers.\n5. Cross-sector coalitions: Groups composed of representatives from different sectors, including government, business, nonprofits, and academia, come together to address complex social and environmental challenges. By working collaboratively, these coalitions can leverage shared resources, knowledge, and influence to drive meaningful change.",
