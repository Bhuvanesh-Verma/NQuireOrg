Adoption of waste reduction and energy and water efficiency measures at their facilities.\n4. Encouragement of customers to participate in reducing their carbon footprints through installation of solar energy systems.\n5. Elimination of waste and adoption of more efficient sustainable practices as a certified B Corporation.\n6. Alternative management strategies for blueberry fields, such as cutting them back biennially with a flail mower instead of burning fuel oil after a harvest.\n7. Implementing solar panel installations on residential properties, which significantly reduces electricity usage and dependence on non-renewable sources of energy.\n8. Engaging in environmentally conscious travel methods, such as choosing public transportation or walking/biking when feasible.",
