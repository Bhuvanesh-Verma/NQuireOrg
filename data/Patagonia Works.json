Firstly, there is a need for better education on issues like dam construction, energy efficiency, and climate change. Secondly, more non-traditional nature conservation organizations should be established to address the lack of inspiring options. Lastly, there appears to be a demand for jobs related to international relations, environment policy, and nature conservation. To address these needs, individuals can pursue further education or training programs in relevant fields, while organizations can focus on creating new initiatives and opportunities in these areas.",
