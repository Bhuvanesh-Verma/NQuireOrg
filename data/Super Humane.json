One notable example is the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training TAACCCT grant which was awarded by the US Department of Labor to the Colorado Helps Advanced Manufacturing Program (CHAMP). This grant aimed to increase the attainment of degrees and certifications in manufacturing in order to better serve employers' needs. Additionally, it appears that the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) has received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with other partners such as Complete Tennessee and Tennessee Labor and Workforce Development. Through this collaboration, CAEL developed a web application called \"TNWorkLearnEarn\" which serves as an interactive job and industry matching tool for students and job seekers in Tennessee.",
