Although it isn't explicitly stated whether they have replaced plastic with other materials, the mention of finding solutions to reduce waste suggests that they might be exploring such options.\n3. Utilizing EcoRoast technology, which offers numerous environmental benefits like reduced energy consumption and lower carbon footprint.\n4. Participating in industry events and conferences, where they showcase their commitment to sustainability and share knowledge with others.\n5. Implementing eco-friendly practices within their operations, such as sourcing green beans from around the world and ensuring responsible production methods.",
