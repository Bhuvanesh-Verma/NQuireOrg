They mention using \"bank-level security and encryption\" across their digital platform, which suggests they prioritize data protection and minimizing electronic waste. Additionally, they emphasize saving customers money on their mortgages, potentially encouraging borrowers to purchase homes more efficiently, leading to reduced energy consumption and resource usage over time. While the lifetime of a home loan extends beyond the scope of typical sustainability initiatives, these efforts contribute to a more environmentally conscious approach within the company culture.",
