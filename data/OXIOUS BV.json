            "result": " Oxious has implemented several sustainable and environmental practices throughout its operations. Some key practices include using recycled materials (up to 50), upcycling production waste, utilizing paper packaging options that are either recyclable or biodegradable, being transparent about their processes and impact on people and planet, paying their local team members above minimum wage, and promoting circularity through post-consumer textile insertion. These efforts demonstrate Oxious' commitment to reducing its ecological footprint, supporting local communities, and driving positive change within the fashion industry.",

Women Project: Oxious has partnered with various organizations to support local women through financial, social, and professional development. These collaborative efforts aim to empower women and provide them with opportunities for growth.\n2. Carriers Sewing Labels & Products Production: Oxious works closely with Stichting Stunt and Talentfabriek to produce high-quality carriers, sewing labels, and other sewing products. Together, these companies help individuals reintegrate into the labor market after facing challenges like unemployment or disability.\n3. Packaging Materials: Oxious uses recycled agricultural waste and recycled cardboard for its packaging materials. By doing so, they contribute to reducing waste and conserving natural resources.\n4. Charitable Donations: Oxious has donated up to 6% of its revenue to various charities, including Christian Refugee Relief, Talentfabriek, Trees for All, and Free a Girl. Their commitment to giving back to the community and supporting important causes is evident in these collaborative efforts.\n5. Circular Economy Initiatives: Oxious is dedicated to achieving circularity in its operations, which includes incorporating more post-consumer textile materials into its production process. By working alongside like-minded partners, they can further promote circular economy principles and minimize their environmental impact.",
