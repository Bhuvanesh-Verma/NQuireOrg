Firstly, they use two evaluation methods - surveys and self-assessments - to evaluate the impact of their tours on society and the environment. Additionally, they utilize the B-Lab B Impact Assessment to ensure their business practices are sustainable, including sourcing local suppliers and using recyclable supplies. Furthermore, Turnstile Tours undergoes a rigorous review process to maintain high standards in terms of sustainability and environmental responsibility. Lastly, they collaborate with various organizations and participate in training programs to promote awareness and education around sustainability issues.",

Additionally, the organization highlighted in the text operates as a Certified B Corporation, emphasizing its commitment to supporting its partners in building capacity and welcoming the public. This focus on commerce also extends to the organization's practice of directing at least 5% of each ticket sold to non-profit partners, demonstrating their dedication to supporting community initiatives.
