These include utilizing indoor growing techniques (CEA) to protect crops while reducing the need for transportation, thus cutting down on emissions. They also use a mobile aeroponics system for farming, which saves water and reduces the carbon footprint compared to traditional agriculture and hydroponics. Additionally, they prioritize innovative solutions to make agriculture more sustainable, such as working ahead of time to ensure a smooth certification process.",
