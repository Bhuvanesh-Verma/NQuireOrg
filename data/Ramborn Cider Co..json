            "result": " The Ramborn Cider Company has adopted several sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. They source fruit from local farmers who maintain multiple trees, as well as individual growers with small plots. Their production methods utilize circular design principles, requiring minimal energy consumption, no irrigation, and the elimination of pesticides. Additionally, the company captures additional carbon through the growth of new trees and their associated biomes. By implementing these practices, Ramborn Cider contributes to the restoration and preservation of biodiversity, soil health, and the overall health of the regional ecosystem.",

This may involve investigating alternative packaging materials, optimizing energy consumption, or developing methods to minimize waste and water usage.\n3.
