            "result": " Throughout their operations, Kotn has prioritized sustainability and social responsibility. They source their primary fiber, cotton, from Egyptian farms located within a 50km radius. Their manufacturers specialize in various forms of production, and Kotn works closely with certified facilities that guarantee fair wages, equal opportunities, safe and healthy working conditions, and zero tolerance for forced or child labor. To minimize the environmental impact of laundering their garments, Kotn recommends machine washing in cold water and allowing items to air dry. By implementing these practices, Kotn demonstrates a commitment to reducing their ecological footprint while ensuring ethical production standards.",
