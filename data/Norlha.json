Another important partnership is with local nomad communities, where Norlha provides training and long-term employment opportunities for skilled artisans. By doing so, they ensure the preservation of traditional textile skills and promote sustainable economic growth within the community. Additionally, Norlha works closely with international luxury markets, transitioning from a mere supplier to becoming a representative of positive luxury.

Additionally, over the past decade, Norlha has invested significant time (over 40 hours) into providing vocational management and textile skills training to its employees. Furthermore, Norlha employs both individuals who have never been to school before and those who have attended some school but prefer a job to herding.
