Solar arrays: A solar array is a collection of solar panels installed on a building's rooftop or at ground level. It generates electricity using sunlight and can help reduce a building's reliance on traditional power sources.\n2. Digital monitoring tools: Modern solar rigs can be equipped with digital monitoring tools that provide real-time data on the performance of the solar array. This includes information such as current energy production, historical performance, and even details about the farm where the solar panels were manufactured.\n3. Online solar performance feeds: These feeds allow users to view the current and historical energy production data from solar arrays. They can be accessed through web portals or mobile apps, making it easy for consumers to track and understand their solar energy generation.\n4. Remote document signing: With advancements in technology, signing documents no longer requires manual signature. Secure software allows individuals to digitally sign documents from anywhere, eliminating the need for in-person meetings.\n5. Home-based solar installation: Instead of having in-person interactions during the installation process, trained solar installers now perform their tasks remotely from home. This helps minimize risks associated with potential exposure to COVID-19.",

            "result": " As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 203, there were several recent developments in the field of solar energy. However, please note that these may have evolved since then. Some notable advancements include:\n\n1. High-efficiency solar cells: Researchers continued to improve the efficiency of solar cells, pushing past the 2% conversion rate barrier. These advances aimed to reduce costs while increasing output.\n2. Perovskite solar cells: There was growing interest in perovskite solar cells, which showed promise in terms of low-cost manufacturing and high efficiencies. Although still considered an emerging technology, perovskites offered potential improvements in solar cell performance.\n3. Bifacial solar modules: Innovations in bifacial solar modules allowed for increased energy capture by allowing light to enter from both sides of the panel. This development could lead to reduced installation costs and improved overall energy yields.\n4. Smart solar inverters: Manufacturers developed smart solar inverters capable of optimizing energy generation based on factors such as weather conditions and time of day. These devices aimed to increase overall solar energy system efficiency.\n5. Solar tracking systems: Improvements in solar tracking systems enabled solar panels to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy capture. This led to increased energy yields and lower costs per watt.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these points represent the state of solar energy as of September 203. For updated information, consult more recent sources.",
