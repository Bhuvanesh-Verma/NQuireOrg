Launching a new program to advance a thriving BIPOC (Black/Indigenous People of Color) regenerative farming community in the Fredericksburg, Virginia region. Pure Strategies played a significant role in developing and funding this innovative program.\n2. Donating to various organizations and causes such as Cape Ann Emergency Relief Fund, Forest for Monarchs, Wildlands Trust Inc., Save the Children, Shelter House Inc., The Lazarus House, and others. Pure Strategies matched employee donations, resulting in substantial contributions from their team members.\n3. Participating in the \"Take What You Need\" Community Solidarity Plot, a project led by Downtown Greens. Pure Strategies contributed to the funds needed to purchase land containing living wetlands, mature trees, and some of the last farmland in Fredericksburg. Together, they aim to preserve this land for teaching the community about sustainable and organic growing techniques while providing accessible open greenspace for the community.",
