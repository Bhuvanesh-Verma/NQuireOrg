By using the self-assessment tool, organizations can gather data to inform policies and practices, develop action plans to improve their contributions toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and communicate and engage with internal and external stakeholders to advance their overall impact on the planet and society.",

One such example is Amfori (formerly known as BSCI), which brings together over 2,00 retailers, importers, brands, and associations from more than 40 countries to jointly address sustainability issues in global sourcing strategies. Another collaboration is between TO THE MARKET, an ethical sourcing and manufacturing platform, and various stakeholders including suppliers, NGOs, and governments to promote responsible production practices and foster a more sustainable and equitable global supply chain. Additionally, there may be partnerships between companies focused on specific aspects of sustainability, such as Geopolitical Tensions and Energy Transition Partnership (GTEP) formed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to address challenges faced by workers and communities due to geopolitical tensions and the transition towards renewable energy sources.",

Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge (first round): A global call for solutions to make artisanal and small-scale mining more environmentally responsible and socially equitable. It was launched in 208 and focused on solutions that could be applied anywhere in the world.\n2. Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge (second round): Made possible through a Global Development Alliance with the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft, Esri, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This second round focuses on solutions for the Amazon and invites finalists from the first round to participate in the second cohort of the Amazon CoLab starting in [year].",
