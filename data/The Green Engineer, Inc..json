            "result": " Through collaboration, both parties aim to achieve shared objectives and desired outcomes. In this case, the collaborating entities include:\n\n1. Organizations seeking energy benchmarking for their campuses: They expect to gain valuable insights into their campus energy use, which will inform decisions about which facilities are suitable for ASHRAE Level II Energy Audits. This process also helps them identify areas where they can improve energy efficiency and reduce costs.\n2. Organizations working on climate action plans: These organizations hope to create comprehensive plans that address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water usage, and waste reduction for existing buildings and future developments. By doing so, they contribute to overall environmental sustainability and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n3. Teams providing energy benchmarking and analysis services: Their primary goal is to assist clients in establishing design targets and evaluating the performance of their buildings relative to other similar building types. This process enables clients to make informed decisions about energy efficiency improvements and investments.\n4. Green Engineers involved in various projects: They focus on achieving sustainable design, construction, and operations across diverse project types and sizes. By doing so, they contribute to reducing the environmental footprint of buildings and promote long-term sustainability.\n5. Educational institutions and other stakeholders: Collaborators in this area aim to integrate mental health education and support systems into the built environment. This includes developing emergency preparedness plans, promoting access to emergency resources, and implementing policies that address gender equity issues related to menstrual products.\n\nThrough these collaborations, all parties involved can expect a range of benefits, such as improved energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact, enhanced occupant well-being, increased resilience in the face of crises, and more equitable access to essential amenities. Ultimately, the collective efforts of these collaborations drive positive change towards a more sustainable and inclusive built environment.",
