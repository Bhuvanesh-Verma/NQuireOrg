Cross-team and department activities aim to foster a strong sense of belonging and teamwork within Genashtim, creating a unified and supportive environment.\n2. Collaborating with Dialogue in the Dark allows Genashtim to win a MYR 60 grant, which they use to train virtually-impaired telemarketers and establish a virtual call center for them. This partnership enables Genashtim to expand their services while supporting people with disabilities (PWDs).\n3. Technical advisory sessions with Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub help Genashtim scale their products and reach new heights. By participating in this program, Genashtim gains valuable insights and resources to enhance their offerings and grow their business.\n4. Genashtim's inclusion in the Zero Project Conference recognizes their efforts to connect persons with disabilities (PWDs) to the global economy through innovative solutions. This recognition motivates Genashtim to continue pushing boundaries and addressing barriers faced by PWDs.\n5. Finally, the diverse backgrounds and experiences of Christian, a highly skilled HR practitioner, and Andrew, a results-driven marketer, contribute to Genashtim's overall success. Their combined expertise allows Genashtim to develop comprehensive HR strategies and effective marketing campaigns, ultimately driving growth and achieving desired outcomes.",
