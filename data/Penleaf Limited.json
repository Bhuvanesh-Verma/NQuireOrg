United Nations Climate Change Conferences (held annually since 195)\n4. Global Landscapes Forum (held biennially since 205)\n5. Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings (held annually since 192)\n\nThese events bring together individuals, organizations, and governments to discuss, collaborate, and take action towards addressing pressing environmental issues.
