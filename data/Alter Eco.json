City Slickers collaboration: Alter Eco and the Erol Foundation joined forces with IGrowth Consulting (IGC) to build infrastructure and support City Slickers, a West Oakland-based organization focused on youth education and urban agriculture. Together, they constructed a vegetable washing station, a mobile woodshop, and an outdoor classroom. They also engaged in community-based activities and learned from other local organizations.\n2. Volunteering at City Slickers: Members of Alter Eco, the Erol Foundation, and IGrowth Consulting returned to City Slickers after their initial collaboration to volunteer their time and skills. They assisted with tasks such as planting, weeding, and fixing a small fence while continuing to strengthen relationships within the community.\n3. Greenpeace partnership: Antoine de Saint-Affrique, founder of Alter Eco, serves on President Barack Obama's White House Committee on Social Innovation and Enterprise. This connection likely facilitated a relationship between Alter Eco and Greenpeace, as both organizations share a focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility. While no specific joint projects have been mentioned, it's possible that there could be future collaborations between the two entities.\n4. The Alter Eco Foundation: With the support of the Erol Foundation, Alter Eco launched the Alter Eco Foundation, which seeks to promote environmental and social justice causes around the globe. Multiplier serves as the foundation's fiscal sponsor, providing administrative and financial support to help the organization achieve its goals.\n5. GIZ involvement: The German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) plays a significant role in various global initiatives related to sustainability, climate change, and environmental protection. Although not explicitly stated, it's possible that Alter Eco and/or the Erol Foundation may have collaborated with GIZ on certain projects or campaigns aimed at addressing pressing environmental issues.",
