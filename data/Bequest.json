The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) continues its work on assessing climate change science and providing policy advice to governments worldwide.\n2. The European Union's Horizon 202 research and innovation program includes several projects focused on clean energy, circular economy, and nature-based solutions. Some examples include the \"FastTrack\" initiative and the \"LIFE\" program.\n3. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) works towards reducing incineration and promoting zero waste, recycling, and proper disposal of waste. They conduct research and advocate for policies supporting these goals.\n4. The Ocean Cleanup organization develops technologies to remove plastic waste from oceans, such as their System 01/Mk 1 device designed to capture plastic debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n5. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation focuses on accelerating the transition to a circular economy, where resources are kept in use for longer and waste is minimized. Their research and initiatives aim to transform the way we produce, consume, and dispose of goods.\n6.
