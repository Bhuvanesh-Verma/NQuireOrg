Ensuring the protection of mature trees surrounding the site during construction, demonstrating commitment to preserving natural resources and maintaining biodiversity.\n3. Committing to being net zero by  through energy efficiency improvements and retrofitting improvements like installing LED lighting and updating doors, windows, and vents to be more energy-efficient.\n4. Embracing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and hiring a national director of Indigenous strategy, showcasing a dedication to address historical injustices and promote equitable relationships moving forward.\n5. Announcing a commitment to becoming net zero by  across their entire portfolio of work, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in response to the global climate emergency.",

This practice not only contributes to the growth and sustainability of these organizations but also creates additional job opportunities and economic benefits for the communities involved.\n4.
