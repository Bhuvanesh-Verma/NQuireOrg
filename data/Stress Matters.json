Global Landscapes Forum\n4. CleanUpTheWorld Weekend\n5. Greenbuild International Conference and Expo\n6. Our Ocean Conference\n7. IUCN World Parks Congress\n8. Bonn Challenge\n9.

Carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases (primarily CO2) emitted by a company or individual, often measured in metric tons per year. This includes direct emissions from operations, such as energy consumption, and indirect emissions from purchased goods and services. By monitoring and offsetting their carbon footprint, the company can better understand and manage its contribution to climate change. Additionally, they evaluate their overall environmental management practices, including their impact on air quality, water conservation, land preservation, and biodiversity. These practices help them identify opportunities for improvement and ensure they operate responsibly within their ecosystem.",

However, some general insights can be gathered regarding the company's performance over the past 12 months. Despite facing challenges such as a \"rollercoaster\" financial situation and tough times for small business owners, the company has managed to achieve their governance goals by focusing on improving their internal processes rather than resting on their laurels. Additionally, they have shown dedication to supporting their employees through difficult times by providing pay raises and addressing immediate needs. Finally, while the company acknowledges the importance of community engagement and impact, they mention having only a few suppliers and not finding much need to expand their supplier base recently.",
