Some of these practices include:\n\n1. Solar energy generation for self-sufficiency in electricity.\n2. Hybrid water regeneration systems presenting the sustainable potential of fashion companies.\n3. Utilization of natural cowhide materials from cars as raw materials for leather products.\n4. Production of high-quality car seat leather that is resistant to friction, humidity, and temperature.\n5. Recycling of nylon material obtained from airbags on car handles to minimize pollution caused by the production of nylon.\n6. Converting materials that complete their original purpose into new products with different purposes.\n7. Leading the natural cycle by recycling marine waste nets and plastic bottles found in the Jeju sea.\n8. Creating Cuckoo windows and windows without any previous existence of windows in the existing factories, thus increasing natural light intake and reducing the need for artificial lighting.",
