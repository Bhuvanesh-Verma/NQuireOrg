            "question": "What environmental impact metrics are reported?",
            "result": " The text mentions several environmental impact metrics related to different aspects of the food and beverage industry. These include:\n\n1. Acid Rain and Oxygen-Free Zones: Studies show that plastic and glass bottles, as well as cans, have varying levels of impact on these environmental issues. Plastic and glass bottle production releases sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain, while can production requires significant amounts of electricity, potentially increasing sulfur dioxide pollution. Both types of packaging material extraction also contribute to phosphate releases, harming rivers and coastal seas.\n2. Carbon Footprint Reduction: Tall, slim aluminum cans used by ZYN are lighter in weight, take up less space, and require less packaging. This reduction in packaging helps minimize emissions when shipping products. Recycling aluminum cans saves approximately 0.2 grams of CO2 per can, demonstrating the positive environmental impact of recycling.\n3. Energy Savings: Switching to aluminum cans has helped ZYN reduce emissions associated with shipping products. A 12-pack of aluminum cans can save enough energy to power a standard passenger car for up to three miles. Aluminum cans can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality, making them a sustainable choice.\n\nThese metrics highlight various ways in which ZYN and other companies in the food and beverage sector can work towards reducing their environmental impact.",
