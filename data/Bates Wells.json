One example is between purpose-driven businesses within a supply chain, which can help both parties approach issues with the same mindset while also promoting sustainability and transparency. Another example is between a client and its suppliers, where the client commits to improving environmental sustainability and creates a positive impact. Additionally, collaboration between technology suppliers and their customers, as well as technology transactions involving mergers and acquisitions or investments, require careful consideration of various legal issues such as contracting, intellectual property, data privacy, and more.
