Encouraging companies to adopt objectives aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n2. Promoting transparency in relation to sustainability efforts and overall practices.\n3. Focusing on mitigating climate change or preserving biodiversity while emphasizing the integration of sustainability at the core of governance.\n4. Identifying and minimising risks associated with projects aimed at achieving positive impacts.\n5. Supporting rehabilitation projects like the Merang Peatland restoration, which results in reduced carbon emissions, prevents forest fires, and returns wildlife to the area, benefiting local communities.\n6. Managing listed assets, including equities and fixed income financing, to facilitate energy transition and promote biodiversity protection.\n7. Reducing the investor's own direct impact through various initiatives and engagements.\n8. Evaluating issuers based on their contributions to climate and sustainability-related goals, taking into account their indirect impact beyond their immediate operations.",

Additionally, Na\u00efo Technologies has developed EV-powered light, intelligent, and autonomous farming robots equipped with proprietary software that supports autonomous field operations, fleet management, and \"intelligent farming\" (Mirova). Furthermore, SafetyNet Technologies has designed and built light-emitting devices that increase the selectivity of commercial fishing, helping fishermen catch the right fish and reduce the capture of non-target species and juvenile fish (12 devices deployed, including 4 commercial trials). Lastly, Plastics For Change has become the world's first Fairtrade-verified plastic recycling company, aiming to create sustainable livelihoods for the urban poor across India while addressing plastic pollution and helping brands and manufacturers meet their sustainability commitments.",

Policy development and implementation: Joint efforts among stakeholders can lead to the creation and enforcement of policies that promote environmentally friendly practices and discourage harmful activities.\n2. Financing and investment: Collaboration can facilitate the allocation of funding toward projects and initiatives focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability.\n3. Industry transformation: By working together, stakeholders can drive change within industries, pushing them to adopt cleaner technologies and practices.\n4. Public awareness and support: Cooperation between different sectors can help raise public awareness about the importance of taking action against climate change, ultimately garnering widespread support for climate-related initiatives.\n5. Research and innovation: Combining resources and expertise across multiple disciplines can accelerate the development and deployment of cutting-edge solutions to combat climate change.\n\nOverall, the expected outcomes of these collaborations include significant progress toward a more sustainable and low-carbon future, as well as increased resilience in the face of climate-related challenges.",
