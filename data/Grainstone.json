They utilize renewable energy sources and employ cutting-edge technologies like bioprospecting and biotechnology to extract maximum potential from the food waste streams. Additionally, they collaborate with organizations like CSIRO (Australia's national science agency) to further advance their research and development efforts. Their focus on creating sustainable and environmentally friendly products aligns with the global goal of reducing food waste while producing eco-friendly materials.",

However, providing a comprehensive list of all such events would be too extensive. Instead, I will provide a smaller selection of notable events and initiatives related to environmental conservation. Here are ten examples:\n\n1. United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP) - These conferences bring together representatives from countries around the world to discuss and negotiate strategies to combat climate change.\n2. World Environment Day - Organized by the United Nations, this annual event raises awareness about environmental issues and encourages global action.\n3. Earth Hour - A worldwide movement organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Earth Hour encourages individuals and organizations to turn off their lights for one hour as a symbolic gesture towards reducing carbon emissions.\n4. Global Climate Action Summit - Hosted by California Governor Jerry Brown in 208, this summit brings together leaders from government, business, and civil society to showcase climate action and inspire further commitments.\n5. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) - This treaty regulates international trade in species threatened with extinction, aiming to ensure their survival.\n6. Bonn Challenge - An ambitious global effort to restore degraded and deforested land, the challenge calls for bringing 17 million hectares of degraded lands into restoration by 2020.\n7. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands - This intergovernmental treaty focuses on the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.\n8. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - Established by the United Nations, the IPCC provides scientific assessments of climate change, its impacts, and potential solutions.\n9. Conference of Parties (CoP) - Similar to the COP meetings held under the UNFCCC framework, CoPs convene under other multilateral environmental agreements like the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer.\n10. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - A set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2017, the SDGs aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all while tackling pressing environmental challenges.",
