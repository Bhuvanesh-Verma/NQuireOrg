Preparing for Summer Camp: Toms employees worked alongside Brave Trails to get ready for their summer camp sessions, ensuring everything was in order for a successful and enjoyable experience for participants.\n3. Volunteering during Office Closures: Each year, Toms closes its global offices for a day to allow employees to participate in volunteer activities with local nonprofit organizations. In Amsterdam, Toms partnered with Regenbooggroep to prepare meals for Ukrainian refugees and clean up gardens and homes to offer people a fresh start. Similarly, the LA and APAC offices teamed up with SuitUp and Trussell Trust to bring positive change to their respective regions.\n4. Artistic Interpretation of Equity: When moving into their new headquarters in Amsterdam, Toms invited a local artist to create an inspiring piece representing equity.
