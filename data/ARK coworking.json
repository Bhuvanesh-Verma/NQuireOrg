            "result": " ARK coworking has integrated several strategies to minimize their impact on the environment while providing high-quality services. Some of these practices include:\n\n1. Using energy-efficient appliances and equipment with automatic sleep modes, after-hour timers, or other power-saving features.\n2. Recycling paper, cardboard, and plastic materials with Islington Council.\n3. Partnering with Castle Water to provide water supply in the past 12 months, estimating approximately m3 of water consumed during this period. Although there was an increase compared to the previous year, efforts were made to conserve water resources.\n4. Evaluating operations to ensure efficiency and minimize waste production.\n5. Encouraging employees, members, guests, and suppliers to participate in recycling initiatives.\n6. Purchasing Energy Star certified equipment and appliances whenever possible.\n7. Utilizing smart heaters and smart plugs to manage energy consumption and turn off electrical equipment automatically when not in use.\n8. Striving to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for employees while adhering to relevant environmental legislation.\n\nBy implementing these sustainable practices, ARK coworking demonstrates its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and promoting eco-friendliness among its members, employees, and guests.",
