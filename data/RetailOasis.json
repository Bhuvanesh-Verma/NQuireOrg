Kroger and Walgreens: These two companies joined forces through strategic collaboration. Kroger opened Kroger Express stores, offering fresh, frozen, and non-perishable items inside select Walgreens locations. Meanwhile, Walgreens-branded health and beauty products were featured in select Kroger stores, enabling both brands to potentially expand their market share.\n3. Adidas and Parley Ocean Plastic: Adidas and Parley designed and created a line of footwear and apparel made entirely from recycled materials, aimed at keeping plastic out of the oceans.
