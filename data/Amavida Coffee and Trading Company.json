            "result": " At Amavida, several sustainable and environmental practices have been implemented to achieve carbon neutrality. Some of these practices include reducing their overall emissions, investing in carbon offsets, partnering with sustainable suppliers, and sourcing from organic coffee cooperatives. Additionally, they have educated themselves on their carbon output and taken action to offset it. They have also invested in the coffee communities they work with by purchasing organic, fair-trade coffee. Overall, Amavida has demonstrated a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and making a positive impact on the communities they work with and their own operations.",

Greenhouse gas emissions: Specifically refers to the release of CO2 and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect and climate change.\n4. Reforestation efforts: Projects aimed at restoring forest cover and promoting afforestation, which helps sequester atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis.\n5.
