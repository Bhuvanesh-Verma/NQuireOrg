However, the text mentions that after completing the course, the company receives analytical reports with indicators such as employee engagement and learning. These reports might include information about the company's progress in meeting its B Corp commitments. Additionally, a percentage of the profit earned from selling the course is invested into a fund managed by a renewed annually committee called \"Projeto MAPA.\" This fund supports transformative actions and projects related to the themes addressed during the training. Therefore, while there doesn't seem to be a dedicated report specifically for the B Corp commitments, the mentioned analytical reports and the investment in the \"Projeto MAPA\" fund can provide insights into the company's progress towards fulfilling their B Corp responsibilities.",
