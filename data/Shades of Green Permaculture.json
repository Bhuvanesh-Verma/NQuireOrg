Integrating waste materials on site to build soil, rather than hauling them away.\n3. Choosing locally grown plants that use organic growing practices.\n4. Diverting cardboard from the waste stream to use in \"sheet mulching.\"\n5. Committing to B Corp standards, which emphasizes social and environmental impact.\n6. Applying an ecological economic model that limits growth and considers impact.\n7.
