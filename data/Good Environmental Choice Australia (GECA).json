By collaborating, members can ensure consistency and credibility in ecolabelling programs while supporting environmentally friendly products and services.\n2. Sustainable Business Matters (SBM) and Thinking Works: In the case provided, Libby Staggs, Principal Consultant at SBM, speaks highly of her experience working with Thinking Works. Collaborations like these can help businesses share knowledge, resources, and best practices to create more sustainable and responsible supply chains.\n3.

Through these collaborations, the government seeks to support businesses in adopting more environmentally friendly and economically efficient strategies.\n4. B Corp movement: B Corporations are businesses that have committed to meeting rigorous social and environmental performance standards. They often partner with other like-minded organizations, suppliers, and customers to create a more sustainable and responsible economy.\n5. United Nations Global Compact: This voluntary initiative encourages businesses to align their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles covering human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.
