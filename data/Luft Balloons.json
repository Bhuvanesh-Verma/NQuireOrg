They have committed to sourcing 5% of their core expenses from local and independently-owned businesses, supporting the local economy and reducing carbon footprint associated with transportation (although no specific information about packaging materials or waste management is mentioned). Additionally, they have pledged 5 hours of employee time per year for pro bono work and give-back missions, demonstrating their dedication to social causes and community engagement. However, there isn't any direct mention of specific eco-friendly practices related to production processes, packaging materials, or waste reduction within the company.",
