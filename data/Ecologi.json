The Global Commission on Adaptation: This commission brings together leaders from various fields to develop and advocate for effective solutions to climate adaptation. It focuses on identifying and promoting scalable and replicable adaptations across different sectors.\n2. Mission Innovation: This initiative brings together governments and private organizations to accelerate clean energy innovation and make clean energy widely available. It aims to dramatically increase public and private clean energy R&D investments.\n3. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition: This coalition consists of private investors who pledge to provide funding for early-stage clean energy research and development. Its goal is to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy sources and create new opportunities for businesses and communities.\n4. The Climate Group's RE10 campaign: This campaign encourages companies around the world to adopt 10% renewable electricity targets. It provides resources and support to help companies transition to renewable energy sources.\n5. The Carbon Removal Atlas: Developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, this online platform maps and tracks carbon removal efforts globally. It serves as a resource for policymakers, businesses, and individuals interested in learning about and supporting carbon removal technologies and practices.",
