One notable example is the \"Source Link\" initiative, which brings together various stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, and businesses to work towards sustainable and responsible sourcing practices. Another collaboration focused on improving the world rather than solely extracting wealth over the short term is the \"Builders\" certification program for B Corporations. These companies aim to address pressing social and environmental challenges while also generating profit. Additionally, there are theme-based investment firms like Builders who focus on backing startups and scaling platforms that tackle specific market themes and social/environmental issues. Finally, many companies are partnering with suppliers, co-packers, and distributors to ensure ethical and sustainable sourcing and production processes throughout their supply chains.",
