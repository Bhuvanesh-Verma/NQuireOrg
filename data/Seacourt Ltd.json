Carbon footprint reduction: Seacourt has managed to reduce its Scope 1 & 2 (direct and indirect) carbon impact to 8% of its total carbon impact. They also ensure that all their Scope 3 emissions are offset using Gold Standard VER offsets, which prevent carbon emissions from occurring in the first place.\n2. Water usage: Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that Seacourt tracks and manages its water consumption and efficiency, given their commitment to minimize their environmental impact across various aspects of their operations.\n3. Waste management: Seacourt has successfully achieved zero-waste-to-landfill status by establishing eighteen independent recycling streams within their facility. This includes diverting production waste away from landfills and implementing innovative solutions such as using worms to help manage food waste.\n4. Energy consumption: Seacourt sources their energy solely from renewable sources, including wind, solar, wave, and biomass energy. By making this transition, they have become a net-carbon-neutral organization.\n5. Supply chain environmental impact: Seacourt partners with Climate Impact Partners to offset the environmental impact of their entire supply chain. This includes investments in Gold Standard o\ufb00sets and VERs, which support projects that create both negative carbon emissions and positive social outcomes.",
