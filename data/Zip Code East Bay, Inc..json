Fourth Annual Colusa Circle 5K: This virtual race was held to raise funds for Sogorea Te' Land Trust, an urban Indigenous women-led land trust that facilitates the return of Indigenous land to Indigenous people. The event had over 3 registered runners, and Zip Code East Bay matched the fundraising dollar-for-dollar, resulting in a total of $66 raised for the Rematriate the Land Fund. This fund supports various initiatives such as growing medicine gardens, creating emergency response hubs, and distributing fresh food to elders.\n2. Third Annual Colusa Circle 5K (virtual race): This virtual race was also organized to benefit a specific cause - Urban Tilth. Urban Tilth is an organization that focuses on employing individuals from marginalized communities while promoting sustainable agriculture and food justice. Although no amount was explicitly mentioned for the third annual race, it can be inferred that similar to the previous year, Zip Code East Bay might have matched the funds raised during the event.",
