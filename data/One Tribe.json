B Corp month is an annual event held in March, focusing on the theme 'BCorps Go Beyond.'\n2. Last year's BehindTheB event focused on the 'behind the scenes' of being a B Corp and building better business practices.\n3. This year's B Corp campaign aims to educate others on why and how B Corps go beyond 'business as usual,' as well as raise awareness about the positive impact of the B Corp movement on the economy.\n4. One Tribe is recognized as a company using business as a force for good, having achieved the Governance award for their work in governance, mission, ethics, accountability, and transparency.\n5. As a remote-first organization, One Tribe has made significant strides in reducing their environmental impact, with half of their workforce moving to fully renewable energy suppliers. They aim to improve further before their next re-certification in three years.\n6. One Tribe is part of the top 5 B-Corporations recognized for their work in the Governance impact area, which highlights their commitment to mission, ethics, accountability, and transparency.",

            "result": " Yes, there are several ongoing and upcoming research projects and innovation initiatives at One Tribe. These projects aim to further enhance the organization's sustainability efforts and contribute to a greener future. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Deforestation monitoring and protection: One Tribe is actively involved in monitoring and protecting forests, particularly in areas such as the Bolivian Amazon and the Leuser Ecosystem on Sumatra. By continuously tracking deforestation rates and implementing effective strategies to combat it, One Tribe contributes to global forest conservation efforts.\n2. Zero-waste refill and eco-stores: In addition to already having protected over 20 trees, One Tribe is committed to expanding its network of zero-waste refill and eco-stores. These stores serve as models for other businesses looking to adopt more sustainable practices, helping to reduce waste and promote circular economy principles.\n3. Carbon neutrality and climate action: One Tribe is focused on supporting its partners and clients in achieving carbon neutrality and advancing climate action goals. To this end, the organization works closely with companies like Santander, Astound, Clearco, Zalando, and Gravity Forms, among others, to develop and implement strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a healthier environment.\n4. Remote work and environmental impact: One Tribe is exploring ways to minimize the environmental impact of its remote workforce. By transitioning workers to fully renewable energy suppliers and encouraging responsible consumption habits, the organization hopes to set an example for other remote-first organizations seeking to optimize their environmental performance.\n5. Collaborating with B Corps and industry leaders: One Tribe remains dedicated to fostering strong relationships within the broader B Corp community and beyond. By engaging with industry leaders, influencers, and other stakeholders, the organization stays informed about emerging trends, technologies, and best practices in sustainability and social responsibility.",
