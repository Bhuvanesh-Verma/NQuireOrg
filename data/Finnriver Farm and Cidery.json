Low chemical use: By using a low chemical system for cleaning their tanks and avoiding mechanical systems that consume more water and chemicals, Finnriver reduces its overall chemical footprint.\n2. Pasteurization and cleaning methods: Using these processes helps minimize the need for harsh chemicals and conserves resources like water and energy.\n3. Reusable polishing towels: This practice reduces waste generated during packaging operations and promotes a circular economy.\n4. Environmentally friendly laundry detergent: By choosing eco-friendly detergents, Finnriver minimizes its impact on local waterways and aquatic ecosystems.\n5. Peri-Acetic Acid (PAA) sanitizer: PAA breaks down into water and vinegar, reducing the use of harmful chemicals and minimizing potential contamination of the environment.\n6. Apple and fruit pomace composting: This practice enhances soil fertility while reducing the amount of organic waste sent to landfills.\n7. Repurposing cardboard for tree planting: This action supports local forest regeneration and carbon sequestration efforts.\n8. CO2 pumping for farmer greenhouses: By utilizing captured CO2, Finnriver supports increased agricultural productivity while also mitigating some of its own emissions.\n9. Energy Star appliances: By using energy-efficient equipment, Finnriver reduces its electricity consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n10. Fair Trade, organic mate and coffee consumption: Supporting ethical and sustainable sourcing practices helps promote responsible land management and labor standards.",

This event promotes a sense of interconnectedness and belonging among the community.\n2.
