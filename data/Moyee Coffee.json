She encourages employees to adopt sustainable practices in their personal lives by providing them with eco-friendly products such as bamboo straws and toothbrushes. Additionally, Marlot personally makes efforts to reduce her environmental impact by choosing not to consume meat and by limiting her air travel. While these actions may not be directly related to the company's operations, they demonstrate Marlot's commitment to promoting sustainability both inside and outside the workplace.",

Carbon surplus indicates the net positive effect on the environment, as it represents the excess of absorbed CO2 compared to emitted CO2.

Seasonal jobs: The passage mentions that some employment opportunities are created during certain seasons. Women seem to be employed disproportionately in these roles.\n3. Coffee farming: The organization mentioned in the passage is working towards improving the livelihoods of coffee farmers, including providing them with access to education and training. This could potentially create new employment opportunities within the coffee industry.\n4. Digitization and innovative tools: The passage discusses efforts to develop digital tools and resources for farmers, such as calculating living income and carbon emissions. These tools may require skilled professionals to design, implement, and maintain them.\n5.

A group of non-organized individual farmers in Ethiopia became RFA (Rainforest Alliance) certified for the first time, which helped those farmers to sell their products to customers who valued sustainability practices.\n2. The organization conducted a study on how to reach young women through digitization and published a report on their findings. They also created a blog where readers could access more information.\n3. In the same year, the organization assisted in setting up a Women Empowerment Committee, leading to a significant increase in female participation in a successful financial empowerment program, benefiting nearly 50 farmers.\n4. The organization implemented blockchain technology for farmer wallets, enabling transparent tracking of earnings and provenance. This allowed for tokenized premiums and payments for farm inputs and services, providing additional revenue streams for farmers.\n5. Moyee became the first to implement a blockchain-based coffee tree planting program, allowing consumers to transfer value directly to farmers. This innovative approach revolutionizes the conventional consumer-producer relationship and contributes to ensuring farmers receive a real living income, with each tree generating an additional \u20ac10 in income per year.\n6. Lastly, the organization introduced an insetting program, turning Moyee's environmental footprint into a positive one by investing in projects that benefit both the environment and local communities.",
