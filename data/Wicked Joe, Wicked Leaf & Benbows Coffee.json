            "result": " The text mentions several sustainable and environmental practices that have been implemented in connection with Ketiara cooperative. Some key points include:\n\n1. Organic agriculture: Ketiara uses organic farming methods, which help to preserve the soil, reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, promote biodiversity, and support a healthier ecosystem. This approach also helps to minimize the depletion of soil nutrients and to naturally control for pests.\n2. Shade-grown coffee: As mentioned earlier, Ketiara grows its coffee trees under a shade canopy, which supports bird populations and fosters mutually beneficial relationships between these species and the coffee fields. This method also helps to minimize soil erosion and participate in a healthy ecosystem.\n3. Fair Trade Premiums: The women of Ketiara cooperative invest a portion of their Fair Trade Premiums back into their farms, aiming to improve productivity and maintain quality. Additionally, they engage in various community development initiatives, such as improving health, education, public infrastructure, and environmental protection efforts in the surrounding area, including supporting the conservation of the nearby Leuser National Park.",

Monthly Farmers Markets: Regular markets are held every weekend, providing a platform for local farmers, producers, and artisans to showcase and sell their products directly to consumers. This not only supports small-scale agriculture but also fosters a sense of community through face-to-face interactions.\n2. Annual Harvest Festival: Held during the autumn season, this festival celebrates the bountiful harvest while educating the community about sustainable farming practices, nutrition, and the importance of supporting local agriculture. The event typically features live music, cooking demos, farm tours, and activities for children.\n3. Green Living Workshops: Periodically throughout the year, workshops are hosted to teach residents about eco-friendly living practices such as composting, rainwater harvesting, and energy efficiency. These workshops aim to promote environmental stewardship and encourage community members to adopt sustainable habits at home.\n4. Neighborhood Clean-up Days: Organized several times a year, volunteers come together to participate in neighborhood-wide clean-up days. This event helps to keep the community beautiful while promoting a sense of unity and pride among its residents.\n5. School Garden Programs: Local schools partner with community gardens to establish educational garden programs. Students learn about plant biology, nutrition, and the importance of sustainable agriculture while contributing to the maintenance and growth of the school garden. This program fosters a connection between students, their local food system, and the environment.",
