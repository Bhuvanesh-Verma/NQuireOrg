Establishing native tree nurseries in Planadas to encourage reforestation efforts among coffee farmers.\n4. Implementing internal strategies and mitigation measures to become more efficient in terms of energy, water, and gas consumption.\n5. Upgrading sorting equipment with energy-efficient machines and installing solar panels on the roof of the dry mill facility in Colombia.\n6. Completing the installation of a second dry milling line dedicated to smaller lots and microlots, which reduces energy requirements while increasing productivity and efficiency.",

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Calculating the company's overall carbon footprint, including direct operations in 9 countries and indirect activities through supply chains.\n2. Farm-level carbon footprint: A significant portion of the carbon footprint is attributed to farms, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts between Caravela and its farmer partners to reduce emissions.\n3. Living Wage: Recognizing the need to improve the quality of life of co-workers and farmers, Caravela focuses on ensuring fair compensation for their contributions.\n4. Organic vs Conventional Farms: Collaborating with Solidaridad and conducting studies to compare the carbon footprint of organic versus conventional farming practices. This helps identify potential reduction opportunities within the coffee supply chain.\n5. Native Tree Nurseries: Supporting initiatives to establish native tree nurseries, promoting reforestation and carbon sequestration efforts in coffee-growing regions.",

They have participated in several initiatives such as the SCA Sustainability Award, which recognizes excellence in sustainability within the specialty coffee industry. By achieving this award, Caravela has demonstrated its dedication to promoting sustainable practices across the coffee sector. Furthermore, the company has implemented a climate-positive supply chain in the Galapagos Islands, ensuring minimal environmental impact while supporting local economies.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, Caravela has joined forces with other like-minded organizations to collaboratively tackle pressing global challenges. These include contributing to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically targeting SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (forest conservation). Through their participation in the B Corporation program, Caravela has formed strong connections with fellow B Corp roaster customers around the world, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among businesses committed to creating a positive social and environmental impact.",

Their website and publications often feature the latest news, research, and innovations within the sector. Visit their website at [www.specialtycoffee.org](http://www.specialtycoffee.org).\n2. Academic Journals: Look for recently published articles in academic journals such as \"Coffee Science\" ([https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/cs/coss/forAuthor/summary.html]) and \"Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry\" ([https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jafcah]). These sources often cover the latest research findings in the field of coffee production, processing, and consumption.\n3. Industry Conferences and Events: Keep an eye on upcoming events and conferences in the coffee industry, such as the annual SCA Expo ([https://scaexpo.org/)]), World Coffee Research Symposium ([https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/symposium/)]), and Global Coffee Platform ([https://globalcoffeeplatfrom.org/)]).
