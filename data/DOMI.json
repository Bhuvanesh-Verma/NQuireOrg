            "result": " There are several key partnerships or collaborations related to commerce that contribute to creating shared value (CSV) and promoting sustainability. Some examples include:\n\n1. Businesses partnering with NGOs, governments, and international organizations to tackle global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and inequality, as mentioned in points 3, 6, and 7. These partnerships help drive innovation and create new markets for sustainable products and services.\n2. Industry associations working together on initiatives like the United Nations Global Compact or the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), as mentioned in point 8. Through these collaborations, companies can share best practices, learn from each other, and advocate for policy changes that support sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n3. Corporations forming strategic alliances with suppliers, customers, and competitors to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce waste, and promote responsible sourcing and production practices, as discussed in points 10 and 11. Collaborating across the value chain can help companies minimize their environmental footprint and ensure social welfare.\n4. Retailers joining forces with manufacturers and recycling firms to develop closed-loop systems that enable the circular economy, as described in points 12 and 13. By working together, these parties can design products that are easily recoverable and recycled, reducing waste and conserving resources.\n5. Financial institutions partnering with businesses to facilitate green bonds issuance, loans for sustainable projects, and other forms of financing that support environmentally friendly and socially responsible investments, as mentioned in points 14 and 15. By providing financial backing for sustainable endeavors, banks and investment funds can encourage more companies to adopt CSV approaches.",
