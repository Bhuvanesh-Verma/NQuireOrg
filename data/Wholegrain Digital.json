            "result": " Throughout the passage, there are several mentions of sustainable and environmental practices that have been implemented by Wholegrain Digital and other organizations mentioned. Some notable practices include:\n\n1. Assessing for B-Corp certification: This helps businesses evaluate their true impact on the environment, customers, employees, and more.\n2. Reducing environmental impact by travelling as little as possible.\n3. Donating to SolarAid through a self-imposed carbon tax, ensuring emission reductions and improvements in health and education in remote African regions.\n4. Contributing to Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) through their membership club, focusing on reducing plastic in the ocean and creating Ecover's Ocean Bottle with collected plastic.\n5. Striving for net negative carbon emissions.\n6. Introducing a no fly policy and supporting employees to reduce their own environmental impact through Climate Perks and the Do Nation platform.\n\nThese practices demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility across various aspects of these organizations' operations.",

Support for SolarAid, which includes funding emission reduction programs in Africa with significant social and economic benefits for the communities affected.\n4. Publication of 25 articles on environmental topics on their website and in other publications.\n5.

These include:\n\n1. Financial Support: Members commit to donating a minimum of 1% (or more) of their annual revenue to their chosen non-profit partners. This direct funding provides crucial financial backing for the non-profits to pursue their environmental goals and initiatives.\n2. Resource Contributions: Members also provide additional resources such as volunteering time, in-kind donations, and expertise to further support their non-profit partners. By combining forces, both parties can leverage their strengths and capabilities to maximize collective impact.\n3. Long-Term Engagement: The foundation of the 1 for the Planet network lies in the establishment of strong, lasting relationships between member companies and their non-profit partners. This fosters continuous collaboration and support, ensuring that the partnerships remain effective and adaptable over time.\n4. Knowledge Sharing & Capacity Building: Member companies share their expertise, knowledge, and best practices with their non-profit partners, enabling the latter to enhance their operations, increase efficiency, and develop new strategies for addressing environmental challenges.\n5. Collective Impact: By joining forces through the 1 for the Planet network, member companies and their non-profit partners aim to create a significant, measurable impact on environmental issues. Together, they hope to drive meaningful change and contribute to a healthier, more sustainable planet.",
