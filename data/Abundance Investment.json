Renewable energy generation: The quantity of renewable energy produced by the project, often measured in kilowatt hours (kWh).\n3. Biodiversity conservation: Efforts taken to protect and restore habitats for wildlife and plants, helping to maintain healthy ecosystems.\n4. Waste reduction: Progress made towards reducing waste sent to landfill or incineration facilities, promoting circular economy practices.\n5. Water resource management: Improvements in managing water resources efficiently, minimizing pollution, and ensuring sufficient supplies for communities and ecosystems.\n6. Social impacts: Positive changes resulting from the project, such as job creation, community engagement, and education initiatives related to environmental sustainability.\n\nThese metrics serve as indicators of the overall environmental impact of the investments made through Abundance.
