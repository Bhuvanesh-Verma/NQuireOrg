However, it is clear that their breakthrough technology for upcycling waste PET plastic and polyester fiber into high purity PET plastic suitable for food-grade packaging represents a significant contribution towards reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable future. Additionally, Loop Industries' technology has the potential to displace traditional petrochemical-based production methods, thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with plastic production.",
