Converting a conventionally-farmed vineyard into an organic one, focusing on healthier soil and biodiversity.\n2. Reducing the amount of sulfur added during winemaking to minimize the environmental impact of the wines.\n3. Planting trees through partnership with One Tree Planted, helping to sequester carbon and promote reforestation.\n4. Committing to donate at least 5% of annual revenue to positive social and environmental impact.\n5. Using steel crown seals instead of screw caps for bottling, which are infinitely recyclable and easily separable from waste streams.",
