            "result": " Throughout their operations, the company has adopted several sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. These include using energy from wind power provided by Arcadia Power, which allows them to monitor and compare their usage against local averages. Additionally, they utilize Docusign for all paperwork, reducing waste and paper consumption significantly. By doing so, they avoid using traditional paper-based methods, such as printing and mailing documents. Furthermore, they have switched to LED lights throughout their office space, replacing any remaining legacy fluorescent bulbs after one of them failed. Finally, they have chosen to locate their office near a recycling center, emphasizing their commitment to responsible waste management.",
